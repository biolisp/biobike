<b>The workspace is your playground for putting blocks of code together.</b>

<h3>The Workspace as a whole</h3>
The green arrows in the upper left corner of the workspace work much the same
way as the broswer's 'Back' and 'Forward' buttons.  You can go back up to 10 
edits in the workspace as well as forward again.  The VPL's back button
transcends both clearing the workspace as well as a browser refresh. <br/><br/>
<img src="arrowsresizeclear.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/>
Moving to the far right one sees the resize icon.<br/>
It's easy to clear the workspace if things get too cluttered, 
by either clicking the Clear icon, the pink box in the upper right corner, 
or by selecting 'Clear Workspace' from the File menu.<br/><br/>
A convenient way of freeing up space within the Workspace is using
Collapse.  <br/>
You can collapse entire function boxes:<br/>
<img src="collapsefunction.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/>
and you can collapse optional arguments:<br/>
<img src="collapseoptions.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/>
You can uncollapse things by selecting 'Expand' in the same menu
you found collapse.  <br/>

<br/>
<a name="save"> </a>
Please note that the Save and Restore workspace options are no longer used.
If you have anything valuable saved in a workspace, resave it as described
below.<br/>
The File menu contains options to save and restore 'user sessions', meaning
the workspace, the results area, any variables you've created with ASSIGN or DEFINE, 
and any functions you've created with DEFINE-FUNCTION.
Give your user session a descriptive name when saving it so that you 
can easily recognize it when you go to restore your session via the File menu.
Saving sessions is useful because the system may be reinitialized 
between one of your sessions and the next, and your work would otherwise be
lost.

<h3> Moving things around </h3>

<a name="moving"></a>

Both holes and functions have pulldown menus, and we refer to this
group as 'nodes'.  The pulldown menus have options helpful
in moving around blocks of code.  <br/>


There are lots of ways to move boxes around in the workspace.  
Moving boxes is safe -- you won't lose any information you've typed in -- 
and useful for that same reason.  <br/>




Functions can be arguments to other functions.  The inverse of passing a 
function as an argument is the use of the SURROUND option in the node's 
pulldown menu.
You can surround a function around any node, making it the first
argument to whatever function you select.
Clicking this option causes a red box to appear around the node to be surrounded.
Then you select a function from the palette.
It is also easy to do the opposite, using UNSURROUND.<br/><br/>
<img src="surround.jpg" alt="ignore" /> <br/><br/>
<a name="copy"></a>
Using the pulldown menu, nodes can be <i>copied</i>
<br/><br/>
<img src="copy.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/><br/><br/>
or <i>cut</i><br/><br/>.
<img src="cut.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/><br/><br/>
You can also select a box and use the keyboard
shortcuts Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+X to cut, instead of using 
the pulldown menu.  
In each case, note the <i>Mode line</i> telling you what has been copied or cut.
<br/><br/>
These values can then be <i>pasted</i> directly to the workspace <br/><br/>
<img src="pastetoplevel.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/>
or into an empty hole.<br/><br/>
<img src="pasteintohole.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/>
You can select an open hole and use the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+Z to paste into the hole, or, with nothing selected,
use Ctrl+Z to paste to toplevel.  <br><br>
We can also INSERT a node into an empty hole.  Click the empty hole,
then select 'Insert' from the pulldown menu of the node you wish to copy over.
<br/><br/><img src="insert.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/>
To insert a node as well as cut it, select 'Cut/Insert'.  Note the mode line.<br/><br/>
<img src="cutinsert.jpg" alt="ignore" /><br/><br/>

Be sure to check out the Function and data boxes page for more useful information.
<br/><br/>
It is also possible to reverse the order of boxes in the workspace.
This is useful if you have a lot of toplevel boxes and they take up
more than a screen-full of workspace area.  New toplevel boxes you create 
will then get placed in the upper left rather than at the bottom of your 
workspace.

<!--
Functions can be arguments to other functions, and we've seen
how to do this by bringing a function down from the palette into
the hole of another function.  But what if you want to do to the opposite?
That is, bring down a function from the palette and place it around a code
block that you've already constructed in the workspace.  
You can do this using the SURROUND WITH feature.
