I have the beginnings of a Behave!-like VPL working and available for
playing with.  My goal was to get this by the end of the year and I
think I just made it.  I've spent the last week or so wrestling with
Javascript, and I have to say, what a pain.

Many caveats -- it's still clunky, you can't do anything real with it,
there are several important missing features (biggest one: ability to
enter text in place of a block) and it currently only works in Firefox
or other Mozilla-type browsers. More importantly, the semantics of the
language is not really defined, since the idea is to hook it up to
BioLite. So right now it does a few things, but it's a pretty random
set of things.

Here's how to play with it:

1) Log into my dev system (not up all the time and the DNS may change):

   http://69.107.92.165:8002/biologin

Your Nostoc password may work, or use mt/mt

2) (bio::vpl)

3) Click left on the resulting block to fill in something, and recurse.

Here's a program you can make that actually does something:
  (sequence upstream from (first (23) of (genes of (anabaena))) of size (23))
where () means a block.

4) Hit the Eval button to run the block program.


Happy New Year and new UI,

Mike

Some small improvements to the VPL:

- it works now from IE

- partly as a consequence of that, menus are now driven from the right
  mousebutton rather than the left

- fixed some glitches so there will be fewer disappearing blocks etc.

The problem with the background loading indicator still eludes me,
since it seems to be intermittent or timing-dependent or
something. But it doesn't seem to affect operation one way or the
other.
