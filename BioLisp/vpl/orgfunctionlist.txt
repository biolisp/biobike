CODING-GENES-OF 
Only concerned with (slotv organism #$genes), 
then loops through to find which ones encode for proteins
Org is main argument, treated as a whole

COMMON-ORTHOLOGS-OF
Deals with lists of organisms, so only the frame name matters
Org is treated as a whole

GENE-LEFT-OF/GENE-RIGHT-OF
Passes the organism to LONE-REPLICON-OR-ERROR which just accesses
(SLOTV organism #$Contiguous-sequences), and changes the organism
to a contig
Org is a keyword, converted to a replicon via LONE-REPLICON-OR-ERROR

GENE-OF
Passes the organism to LONE-REPLICON-OR-ERROR which just accesses
(SLOTV organism #$Contiguous-sequences), and changes the organism
to a contig

Also calls GENES-OF-ORGANISM which accesses
(slotv (canonicalize-loaded-organism-designator org) #$Genes)

Org is main argument, converted to a replicon via LONE-REPLICON-OR-ERROR
But when calling GENES-OF-ORGANISM, treated as a whole

GENE-NAMED
Calls (BB-GENE-NAMED-GENERAL gene-name organism), which turns
a string name into a frame
Org is keyword, treated as a search space 

CHROMOSOME-NAMED
Gets the organism-prefix and contigs of all loaded organisms
Org isn't an argument to the function, but is treated as all its contigs

INVERSION-OF
Loops over (SLOTV entity #$Contiguous-sequences) so that it can call
EXTRACT-SEQUENCE on each replicon
Treated as a whole of its contigs

NAME-OF
Calls BB-STRING-OF on entity, unless SHORT is provided
Treated as a whole, just uses the prefix and calls BB-STRING-OF
which just gets the name

NICKNAMES-OF
Simply calls (SLOTV entity #$NICKNAMES)
Treats org as a whole, to get the nicknames slot

NONCODING-GENES-OF
Simply calls (SLOTV entity #$NONCODING-GENES)
Treats org as a whole, to get noncoding-genes slot

NUCLEOTIDE-DISTANCE
Calls (SLOTV contig #$Contiguous-sequences) and sets entity to the
first contig
Changes org to a contig

OFFICIAL-PREFIX
Simply calls organism[.Organism-prefix]
Treated as a whole

ORGANISM-NAME 
Simply returns the organism
Treated as a whole

ORGANISM-NAMED
Accesses fname, nicknames, alternative-names, and organism-symbols of organism
Treated as a whole

ORTHOLOG-OF
Calls BBI::TWO-WAY-ORTHOLOG-OF (via ORTHOLOG-OF-AUX) or another user-supplied
function on a gene/protein and the organism
Depends on what the user-supplied function is

ORTHOLOG-OF*
Calls BIOLISP::TWO-WAY-BEST-BLAST-ORTHOLOG-OF-TMP (via ORTHOLOG-OF-AUX-TMP)
or another user-supplied function on a gene/protein and the organism
Depends on what the user-supplied function is

HOMOLOG-OF*
Calls BIOLISP::FORWARD-BLAST-ORTHOLOGS-OF-TMP (via HOMOLOG-OF-AUX-TMP)
or another user-supplied function on a gene/protein and the organism
Depends on what the user-supplied function is

PROTEIN-OF
Calls PROTEINS-OF-ORGANISM on the organism
Org is treated as a whole for its proteins

REPLICON-OF
Simply calls (SLOTV entity #$CONTIGUOUS-SEQUENCES)
Treated as a whole, for all its replicons


                  
3level.bike

INTERGENIC-SEQUENCES-OF
Loops for gene in (GENES-OF entity)
Treated as a whole, to get its genes

CHROMOSOME-OF
First checks to see if the organism is completed (SLOTV entity #$COMPLETED),
then calls (FIRST (SLOTV entity #$CONTIGUOUS-SEQUENCES))
Org argument becomes a contig

GENES-DESCRIBED-BY
If domain or (and domain full), calls kegg-genes-with-motifs-aux
which calls (bio::KEYWORDIZE (FIRST (SPLIT org[.organism-prefix] AT ".")))
Otherwise calls GENES-DESCRIBED-BY-AUX which loops for (gene-of entity)
and gets $Description, $Best-hit-descr, $Annotation, $Sub-function, 
$Sub-function, $EC-description, and #$Gene-name.
Org is treated as a whole over the genes

GENES-IN-PATHWAY/S
Calls KEGG-ORG-OF on the organism
Org treated as a whole

LENGTH-OF
Loops over the replicons in entity[.Contiguous-sequences]
and sums the sequence-lengths
Org treated as a whole

Downstream-sequences-of/Upstream-sequences-of
Simply calls entity[.Genes]
Org treated as a whole

Sequence-of
Loops for contig in (SLOTV entity #$Contiguous-sequences)
Org treated as a whole


4level.bike

COUNT-OF/COUNTS-OF
Loops for replicon in (SLOTV target #$Contiguous-sequences), so it can extract
the sequence
Org treated as a whole

BACKGROUND-FREQUENCIES-OF-NEW
Calls TO-PSSM-SEQUENCE on the organism, which maps EXTRACT-SEQUENCE
over the contig
Treated as a whole

BACKGROUND-FREQUENCIES-OF
Calls either REPLICONS-OF or PROTEINS-OF on the organism
Treated as a whole

DISPLAY-SEQUENCE-OF
Gets the LENGTH-OF entity, calls SEQUENCE-OF, and gets NAME-OF
Treated as a whole

GC-FRACTION-OF
Calls (SEQUENCE-OF entity)
Treated as a whole

POSITION-OF
Calls BB-POSITION-OF which calls (SEQUENCE-OF entity)
Treated as a whole

RANDOM-DNA
Goes to RANDOM-DNA-AUX, which either calls (SEQUENCE-OF like)
or (BACKGROUND-FREQUENCIES-OF like)

HEADER-OF
Gets (NAME-OF entity), then JOINs that with with the length and some strings
Treated as a whole


5level.bike
