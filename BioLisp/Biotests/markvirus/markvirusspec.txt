Markvirus

Chromosome is non-circular
First line (1-60) does not encode
Second line (61-120) encodes whole forward gene
Second gene begins on third line and ends on fourth line
Third and fourth genes overlap on the fourth line (FF)
Fifth and sixth genes overlap (BB) on the sixth line
Seventh and eighth genes overlap (FB) on the eighth line
Ninth and tenth genes don't overlap but both exist entirely on the eleventh line with a gap
11th and 12th genes are adjacent and exist entirely on the 12th line

nextcontig is circular
Two overlapping genes, both crossing the boundary









Organism will need



2 contigs, 1 circular, 1 non-circular

then inside well test

line with no genes
line with 2 genes right next to each other
line with 2 genes with a gap

overlapping FF, BB, and FB

test triple overlap?
