    <h1>The BioBike Language</h1>
    <p>Some features that have been requested for the BioBike language
    require us to provide our own evaluation rule that is slightly
    different from Common Lisp's. One in particular is the ability to use
    bare symbols to refer to genes and organisms (which are represented by
    frames in the frame system) without any reader macros such <code>#$</code>
    and <code>#^</code> and also without having to include the frame "prefix"
    (the <code>Npun.</code> in names like <code>Npun.NpF0001</code>). Other features
    that are best handled by taking control of evaluation are the
    <code>[...]</code>  notation for subscripting operations and the need to
    allow BioBike functions to be defined as macros without having to
    forward declare them.</p>
    <h2>The new evaluation rule</h2>
    <p>The main difference between the BioBike evaluation rule and Common
    Lisp's is that BioBike is aware of the frame system and can evaluate a
    bare symbol in a value position as a reference to a
    frame. Conceptually we want to make it appear that the BioBike
    environment is prepopulated with constants whose names are the names
    and nicknames of all the named frames in the frame system and whose
    values are the frames. We could in fact implement it that way except
    that when the frame system has several billion named frames (stored in
    AllegroCache) we won't be to keep them in memory as Lisp constants.</p>
    <p>Instead we will implement the following evaluation rule for symbols in
    value positions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the symbol is the name of locally bound variable, the symbol
         evaluates to the value of the variable.</li>
      <li>If the symbol is the name of a globally bound variable or constant,
         the symbol evaluates to the value of the variable.</li>
      <li>Otherwise we attempt to resolve the symbol as the name of a
         frame. If the name contains a dot it is resolved as a
         fully-qualified frame name. If there is no dot in the name, then we
         look in each of the current "frame modules" (described below) for a
         name consisting of the frame module's prefix, a dot, and the
         <code>SYMBOL-NAME</code> of the symbol.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If none of these cases provide a value for the symbol, we signal an
    error.<sup>1</sup></p>
    <h2>Frame modules</h2>
    <p>In order to allow users to use "simple" names such as <code>NpF0001</code>
    to refer to frames whose fully-qualified names include a prefix
    (<code>Npun</code> in this case) we need to provide a mechanism by which
    users can control how simple names are resolved into fully-qualified
    names.</p>
    <p>The mechanism will be "frame modules" which map simple names to frames
    in a way analogous to how Common Lisp packages map simple names to
    interned symbols.<sup>2</sup> A frame module defines a set of prefixes that can be
    used to form fully-qualified names from simple names. A simple frame
    module consists of a single prefix such as <code>Npun</code>. Composite
    frame modules can be built up by "using" other frame modules. As with
    packages, there is always a "current" frame module. In the weblistener
    each user will be given their own frame module so that new frames they
    create will be in a distinct namespace from frames created by other
    users. But just as user's packages use the packages containing the
    names of standard Common Lisp and BioBike functions, so too will their
    per-user frame modules use the frame modules containing the names of
    the frames they are likely to need ready access to. The administrator
    of a BioBike installation will be able to specify the base frame
    module for per-user frame modules, making sure that things "just work"
    for users making normal use of the system. For instance, on a system
    used primarily by cyanobacteriologists the base frame module would
    likely include the frame modules containing the relevant organisms, GO
    data, Kegg data, and possibly OC frames.</p>
    <p>Since it is possible that a frame module could be composed by
    combining two or more frame modules that share certain simple names,
    we'll need some mechanism for resolving the ambiguity. We could adopt
    an approach similar to Common Lisp packages, requiring the author of a
    frame module to resolve any ambiguities when they define the frame
    module, choosing the name from one frame module or the other. However
    this requires that the system can detect such ambiguities efficiently
    which may not be feasible if some of these frame modules are going to
    contain billions of names. There are a number of ways to resolve this
    from a simple minded ordered search (search module Foo before Bar so
    if they share a simple name, the one in Foo is used) to providing an
    easy way to include only a specific subset of the names in another
    frame module. We'll have to think more about this once we've got the
    basic frame module machinery in place.</p>
    <h2>Preventing redefinition of globals</h2>
    <p>Because the built-in frames are conceptually constant values we want
    to make sure that users can't accidentally redefine those names. And
    because frame names will now live in the variable namespace that means
    that we need to prevent two things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating a new frame with the same (simple) name as an existing
         frame in the current frame module.</li>
      <li>Defining a new global variable with the same name as the simple
         name of any existing frame in a used frame module.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The motivation for these restrictions to increase the
    comprehensibility of programs. If most users are using a user-specific
    frame module that uses a standard set of other domain relevant
    modules, then it will improve program clarity if globally accessible
    names mean the same thing from program to program. We may provide a
    way for sophisticated users to get around this restriction, perhaps by
    selectively removing certain names from their frame module.</p>
    <p>It might also be worthwhile to extend whatever mechanism we implement
    for protecting frames to protecting global variables--if the system
    defines global variables other than frames, the same argument against
    allowing users to arbitrarily redefine them applies. Note however that
    the prohibition against redefining frames and possibly global
    variables does not prevent locally rebinding these names. It's
    perfectly legal (though maybe not entirely wise) to say:</p>
    <pre>
(let ((NpF0001 (random 100)))
  ...)
    </pre>
    <p>All this means is that within the scope of that <code>LET</code>, the simple
    name of frame <code>Npun.NpF0001</code> is shadowed by the local variable
    <code>NpF0001</code>.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <h2>New syntax: [] and {} </h2>
    <p>The new BioBike language will also provide two new syntactic features:
    the use of <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> as a subscripting operator as in
    C/Perl/Java/Python and the use of <code>{...}</code> as a shorthand way of
    building lists, to avoid having to write <code>(list ...)</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>{...</code>} to <code>(list ...)</code> transformation is easily
    implemented with a regular Common Lisp reader macro. The only cost is
    that we are then burning <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> for this purpose--they
    can't be used later for something else like delimiting a section of
    infix math, e.g. <code>(setf x {y * (2 + z)})</code>.</p>
    <p>Using <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> as subscripting operators requires both
    customizing the reader and support from the BioBike
    evaluator. Basically we will cause the reader to read <code>[</code> and
    <code>]</code> as separate tokens and then in the evaluator to look for
    occurrences of these tokens and translate:</p>
    <pre>
<i>thing</i> [ <i>subscripts</i>* ]
    </pre>
    <p>into:</p>
    <pre>
(ref <i>thing</i> <i>subscripts</i>*)
    </pre>
    <p>where <code>REF</code> is a macro that expands into code that does run-time
    type checking on the value of <i>thing</i> as necessary to determine how
    to treat the values of <i>subscripts</i> as subscripts.<sup>4</sup> The objects that will support subscripting are frames (which can
    be subscripted with slot names), hash tables (subscripted with keys),
    and arrays (subscripted with integer indices). We could also define a
    generic function protocol for subscripting so new kinds of objects can
    be used with the <code>[]</code> syntax.</p>
    <p>We have not yet completely defined the exact semantics of <code>REF</code>
    (and thus of the <code>[]</code> syntax).  Some examples given during
    discussion implied that a form like <code>a[x y z]</code> should be
    equivalent to <code>(list a[x] a[y] a[z])</code> but we haven't discussed
    all the details. Some folks might expect it to be equivalent to a
    multidimensional indexing operation, i.e. <code>a[x][y][z]</code>. We'll
    need to sort that out.</p>
    <h2>BioBike DEFINE-FUNCTION</h2>
    <p>While several of the basic BioBike language features will be provided
    by the new evaluator, there are a number of features that will be
    provided by a new <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> macro. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Handling of keyword arguments including allowing use of bare
        symbols and synonyms.</li>
      <li>"Flag" arguments--keyword arguments that take now subsequent
        argument but are simply provided or not (i.e. their value is always
        <code>T</code> or <code>NIL</code>.)</li>
      <li>Runtime checking of argument types and generation of meaningful
        error messages.</li>
      <li>Runtime coercion of arguments by type.</li>
      <li>Automatically generating documentation of allowed argument types.</li>
      <li>Providing infrastructure for better error messages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The new <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> will actually be slightly misnamed
    because it's actually going to define a macro (and an associated
    function). The basic idea is that <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> will allow
    the function author to specify declaratively how the argument list is
    to be parsed and will generate a macro to do the parsing, binding the
    parameters appropriately before invoking an auxiliary function
    containing the actual code. For instance, the following definition:</p>
    <pre>
(define-function foo 
  required (x)
  keyword (y)
  flag (z)
  body
    (if z (do-stuff x y) (do-other-stuff x y)))
    </pre>
    <p>might generate something like the following macro<sup>5</sup>:</p>
    <pre>
(defmacro foo (&amp;whole form &amp;rest args)
  `(let ((*stack* (cons ',form *stack*))
         (x ,(first args))
         (y ,(cadr (member 'y args :test #'symequal)))
         (z ,(if (find 'z args :test #'symequal) t nil)))
     (foo-aux x y z)))
    </pre>
    <p>and the following definition of <code>FOO-AUX</code><sup>6</sup>:</p>
    <pre>
(defun foo-aux (x y z)
  (if z (do-stuff x y) (do-other-stuff x y)))
    </pre>
    <p>Which can then be called like this:</p>
    <pre>
(foo 10)
(foo 10 y 20)
(foo 10 y 20 z)
(foo 10 z y 20)
    </pre>
    <p>The dynamic variable <code>*STACK*</code> will be used when generating error
    messages and stack traces.</p>
    <p>More elaborate functions will specify that certain arguments must be
    of certain types and the macro will generate code that checks the
    types at runtime, generating uniform error messages in the case of a
    type mismatch. It can also generate code that knows how to coerce
    actual arguments to the required types in well-defined ways. For
    instance we might define that a coding gene can be coerced to the
    protein that it codes for. Then (again using a particular syntax for
    illustration only) the following definition:</p>
    <pre>
(define-function bar
  required p
  type p (or gene protein)
  convert p to protein
  summary "Does stuff with a protein."
  (do-stuff p))
    </pre>
    <p>might define a macro like this:</p>
    <pre>
(defmacro bar (&amp;whole form &amp;rest args)
  `(let ((*stack* (cons ',form *stack*))
         (p (let ((#:g1 ,(first args)))
              (cond
               ((gene-p #:g1) 
                (or (convert #:g1 'protein)
                    (error "~a argument to ~a in ~s is a ~a but can not be converted to a ~a"
                           'p 'bar ',form 'gene 'protein)))
               ((protein-p #:g1) #:g1)
               (t (error "~a argument to ~a in ~s not a ~{~a~^ or ~}"
                         'p 'bar ',form '(gene protein)))))))
     (bar-aux p)))
    </pre>
    <p>The type information attached to the function parameters will also be
    used to automatically generate part of the function documentation. For
    instance the documentation of <code>BAR</code> might start something like
    this:</p>
    <pre>
Function BAR
    </pre>
    <pre>
  Does stuff with a protein.
    </pre>
    <pre>
Arguments:
    </pre>
    <pre>
  <i>p</i> -- a gene or protein. If a gene, must be a coding gene
  which is converted to the protein for which it codes.
    </pre>
    <p>The last bit, about the gene needing to be a coding gene, etc. will be
    boilerplate that is specified once, when we define how to convert a
    gene to a protein. This does, of course imply that there is a single
    way to convert a gene to a protein. Which seems like a good idea given
    the goal of providing consistency across functions BioBike. However we
    have some flexiblity there. Our current thinking is that there will be
    a way to define a conversion from one type to another. Perhaps
    something like this:</p>
    <pre>
(defconversion gene -&gt; protein (g) ...)
    </pre>
    <p>where <code>...</code> is the code that does the conversion. This defines
    the default conversion which will be used when a
    <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> contains a clause like "<code>convert p to
    protein</code>" and the actual type of the argument is a gene. Always using
    the same conversion obviously increases the overall consistency of the
    language and its libraries. However there may be times when the
    default conversion is inapproriate. If we need to support other
    conversions we can allow <code>DEFCONVERSION</code> to define named
    conversions, perhaps like this:</p>
    <pre>
(defconversion gene -&gt; protein (g) :named foo
  ...)
    </pre>
    <p>and then in <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> change the <code>convert</code> clause
    to:</p>
    <pre>
convert p to protein using foo
    </pre>
    <p>In general the hope is that as we develop the library of standard
    BioBike functions well converge on a small set of useful conversions
    which can then be used consistently in the standard functions and in
    new user-defined functions.</p>
    <p>We do expect that new programmers are gaing to use
    <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> to write their functions. Indeed part of the
    point of providing a declarative syntax for argument types and
    conversions is to minimize the amount of code folks have to write--by
    specifying:</p>
    <pre>
type p (or gene protein)
convert p to protein
    </pre>
    <p>the programmer will get a whole pile of code generated for them that
    will check the actual types of arguments passed to the function, will
    convert arguments to the expected type in a consistent and correct
    way, and will emit comprehensible error messages if the function is
    called with incorrect argument types or with objects that can't be
    converted to the desired type. Additionally, programmers who think
    clearly about what types of arguments their functions are supposed to
    be called with will be well on their way to writing functions that
    actually that work.</p>
    <h2>The Just in Time compiler</h2>
    <p>When Common Lisp is compiled the programmer needs a fair bit of
    sophistication to understand when different bits of code need to be
    compiled relative to each other and when different pieces need to be
    recompiled to pick up changes made in other code. For instance, a
    macro must be defined before you can compile a function that uses that
    macro. And if the macro is changed, already compiled function that use
    it must be recompiled to pick up the new macro definition.</p>
    <p>In BioBike these problems will get even worse because every BioBike
    function defined with <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> will be defined partly as
    a macro so every function redefinition could potentially require
    recompiling all callers of that function.</p>
    <p>Rather than force BioBike users to deal with those kinds of issues we
    will remove any notion of explicit compilation from the language,
    relying instead on a Just in Time (JIT) compiler that will be built
    into the BioBike evaluator.<sup>7</sup></p>
    <p>Thus if a user defines the following two functions:</p>
    <pre>
(define-function foo (x) 
  (bar x))
    </pre>
    <pre>
(define-function bar (x)
  (if (plusp x) (foo (1- x))))
    </pre>
    <p>the BioBike evaluator will defer compilation of <code>FOO</code> until
    <code>BAR</code> has been defined since it doesn't know how to compile the
    form <code>(bar x)</code> until it knows the definition of <code>BAR</code>. In
    fact there is no need to compile <code>FOO</code> until the first time it is
    called, at which point all the operators used in <code>FOO</code> must have
    been defined.</p>
    <p>Similarly, after <code>FOO</code> and <code>BAR</code> have both been defined and
    run, and thus compiled, if the user redefines <code>BAR</code> the JIT
    infrastructure will note that <code>FOO</code> depends on <code>BAR</code> and
    thus needs to be recompiled.<sup>8</sup> Under
    the covers the JIT may go ahead and try to recompile <code>FOO</code> rather
    than waiting until it is called (to increase the responsiveness of the
    system) but it will not bug the user with an error message if the
    change to <code>BAR</code> has rendered the current version of <code>FOO</code>
    invalid--instead it will add an element to a list of current
    inconsistencies indicating that there is an inconsistency between
    <code>FOO</code> and <code>BAR</code> that was introduced by a change to
    <code>BAR</code>. If the user then redefines <code>FOO</code> to be compatible
    with the new version of <code>BAR</code>, the JIT will remove the
    inconsistency from the list and the user will never be
    bothered. However if the user tries to invoke <code>FOO</code> before the
    inconsistency has been resolved, the JIT will issue an error message,
    explaining when the inconsistency was introduced. In other words, the
    system won't bother a user about inconsistencies between definitions
    until it absolutely has to--when it is asked to run some code which is
    presenly ill-defined.</p>
    <p>However, we do expect to provide a user interface that will allow the
    user to browse the inconsistency list at any time. This list can then
    be used as a short-term todo list--after the user changes <code>BAR</code>
    the system will be able to tell them all the places they need to
    change to bring the whole system back into a consistent
    state.<sup>9</sup></p>
    <h2>Open issues</h2>
    <p>After several go-rounds, the only wrinkle introduced by this proposal
    that JP and I can think of is the question of what to do with
    <code>#$</code> and <code>#^</code>. </p>
    <p>One theory is that they are not supported in BioBike. Which, I
    suspect, certain biologists will see as a feature, not a bug. The only
    drawback of that approach is that we then we can't use <code>#$Foo</code> as
    a (Lisp) readable syntax for printing frame objects. Which may not
    matter since frames can now be referred to simply with a symbol.</p>
    <p>An variant on that theory is that they are half supported--the printer
    will use <code>#$</code> to print frame objects and the reader will
    understand it. However the name that appears after <code>#$</code> will
    always be fully qualified--the reader macro and printer will no
    nothing about frame modules.</p>
    <p>A more radical alternative is to keep <code>#$</code> and to enhance it to
    understand frame modules so you can say <code>#$NpF0001</code> instead of
    <code>#$Npun.NpF0001</code>. The problem with this approach it is a fairly
    serious change to the existing frame system as used from existing
    Common Lisp code and thus could break stuff, requiring us to spend a
    lot of time tracking things down and fixing them. Thus one of the
    first two theories (no support or half support) seem preferable.</p>
    <h2>Sample transcript</h2>
    <p>What follows is a sample (fake) transcript demonstrating how some of
    the proposed features and semantics would work in the new BioBike
    environment.</p>
    <p>First we interrogate the frame modules used by the current
    module. "System" is the special frame module which has no prefix.</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (frame-modules)
("Jelhai" "System" "Npun" "P9313" ... "Go" "Kegg" "OC")
    </pre>
    <p>The <code>FROM</code> frame is in the System module, and thus available via
    it's simple name:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; from
#$from
    </pre>
    <p>Other frames can likewise be accessed via their simple names:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; pmt0016
#$P9313.pmt0016
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; pmt0016[from]
18916
    </pre>
    <p>The system protects us from redefining names that already name
    existing, accessible frames:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (setq pmt0016 5)
    </pre>
    <pre>
Error: PMT0016 is an alias for frame #$P9313.pmt0016
You are not allowed to change its meaning by assigning it a new value.
    </pre>
    <p>The frame <code>virginia</code> doesn't exist, so it gets created in the
    user's frame module:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; #$virginia
#$jelhai.virginia
    </pre>
    <p>Since <code>virginia</code> is a frame, the system knows that <code>capital</code>
    must be the name of a frame, but it doesn't know what <code>richmond</code>,
    which doesn't exist, might be. There the system must be told that it
    is a frame.  This is done using either '.' notation as a prefix or
    with <code>NEW-FRAME</code>, shown below. The '.' notation is a special
    syntax for referring to frames in the user's frame module. This
    notation is normally only needed to refer to frames that are just
    being created since using a plain symbol would result in an undefined
    variable error since the frame doesn't exist yet. In other words,
     is a shorthand for writing <code>(new-frame foo)</code>.</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (assign virgina[capital] richmond)
Error: RICHMOND is not a variable which has a value or
the name or alias of a frame.
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (setf virginia[capital] .richmond)
#$jelhai.richmond
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; capital
#$jelhai.capital
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (setf virginia[governor] fred-flintstone)
    </pre>
    <pre>
Error: fred-flintstone is not a variable which has a value or
the name or alias of a frame.
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (setf virginia[governor] (new-frame fred-flintstone))
#$jelhai.fred-flintstone
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (df virginia)
    </pre>
    <pre>
Slots of #$jelhai.virginia
  capital: #$jelhai.richmond
  governor: #$jelhai.fred-flintstone
    </pre>
    <p>Lexically bound variables are always allowed, and always take
    precedence:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (let ((virginia 10))
    (virginia[governor]))
    </pre>
    <pre>
Error: Attempt to access a component of '10', but no method has been
defined to access an object of type 'fixnum'
    </pre>
    <p>Since #$VIRGINIA is "shadowed" by the lexical variable
    <code>virginia</code>, the only way to refer to the frame is with '.'
    notation.  However, it's bad form to lexically shadow a frame you want
    to refer to, because it makes the code really obscure</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (let ((virginia 10))
    (setq virginia 5)
    (setf .virginia[governor] .wilma-flintstone)
    (list virginia .virginia[governor]))
    </pre>
    <pre>
(5 #$jelhai.wilma-flintstone)
    </pre>
    <p>But sometimes it makes sense to shadow frame names because the names
    have useful connotations / meanings:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (let ((from 5) (to 10)) (subseq my-string from to))
"xyzzy"
    </pre>
    <p>All the frames and global variables conceptually live in a single
    namespace and the system protects the user from accidentally
    clobbering preexisting definitions:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (new-frame from)
Warning: The frame #$From already exists. No new frame
is being created.
NIL
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (new-frame elhai.from)
Error:  You cannot create your own frame FROM, because a
sytem frame FROM already exists.
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (define my-own-variable 3)

Error: You cannot create a frame called MY-OWN-VARIABLE because
a global variable of that name already exists and has a value.
Type (undefine my-own-variable) to undo the global variable
definition and then you will be able to create a frame by that name.

Error: A frame, #$JELHAI.ALABAMA already exists. You cannot define
a global variable with the same name. Type (undefine alabama)
to delete the ALABAMA frame from the system and then you can
define it as a global variable.

    <p>Here are some examples of the proposed <code>[]</code> subscripting syntax
    (assuming 0-based indexing for the moment):</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (setq x (copy-seq "abcdefg"))
"abcdefg"
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (assign x[1 3 5] "xyz")
"xyz"
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; x
"axcyezg"
    </pre>
    <p>And here's the <code>{}</code> notation:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (define my-genes {pmt0001 pmt0003 pmt0016})
(#$p9313.pmt0001 #$p9313.pmt0002 #$p9313.pmt0016)
    </pre>
    <p>And the new doless <code>LOOP</code>:</p>
    <pre>
&gt; (loop for g in my-genes (print g[from]))
(1256 19484 34555)
    </pre>
    <pre>
&gt; (loop for g in my-genes collect g[from to] finally (print 'foo))

    <p><sup>1. </sup>If we decide to support symbol macros we will insert a
    rule for local symbol macros between 1 and 2 and a rule for global
    symbol macros between 2 and 3.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>2. </sup>One might ask why we don't just name frames
    with symbols and use packages to manage the namespace issues. The
    reason is that we anticipate having "billions and billions" of frames
    in the database (once it moves into AllegroCache) and we don't want to
    devote several gigs of main memory just to holding the names of all
    those frames.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>3. </sup>From a Common Lisp point of view frames are thus
    more like global variables than true constants since it is undefined
    behavior to bind the name of a constant. However they are not like
    Common Lisp global variables (i.e. those created with <code>DEFVAR</code> or
    <code>DEFPARAMETER</code> since the frame names are not declared special--a
    local variable binding of a name that happens to be the name of a
    frame is still a lexical, as opposed to dynamic, binding. In fact we
    may choose to provide "global lexical" variables--variables that are
    global but not special, probably as the default style of global
    variable. Dynamic variables will be available to those who really want
    them, when they want them, either via a declaration or, possibly, via
    a naming convention--variables with names starting and ending with
    <code>*</code> will be made special.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>4. </sup>One issue we
    need to resolve is whether to do this transformation before or after
    macro expansion. Doing it before has the advantage of shielding macro
    writers from a non-sexp syntax. However it has the possible
    disadvantage that there's now a disconnect between the forms of the
    code as written (and read by the Lisp reader) and the forms seen by a
    macro. However, that's arguably no different from the disconnect
    introduced by <code>CL:QUOTE</code> so maybe we don't need to worry about
    it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>5. </sup>The actual
    argument list parsing needs to be a bit more sophisticated than what is
    shown here but not a lot more. The specific syntax shown here is also
    just for illustration--we can fight about the exact syntax later.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>6. </sup>The actual name
    will, of course, be gensymed. We have to put the actual body in a
    separate function to allow mutually recursive BioBike functions--if we
    put the body from the <code>DEFINE-FUNCTION</code> form directly into the
    macro expansion and it contained "calls" to itself or to another
    BioBike function (i.e. macro) that contained calls to the original
    function (macro) the macro expansion would never terminate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>7. </sup>From a Lisp point of view, one way to
    look at this is that we're providing a purely interpreted language
    (semantically speaking) but that our technique for interpretation uses
    just in time compilation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>8. </sup>Strictly speaking, <code>FOO</code> only
    needs to be recompiled if the argument parsing (macro) part of
    <code>BAR</code> has changed. The JIT may be able to detect that, and avoid
    unnecessary recompilation but that is an implementation detail.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='note'>
    <p><sup>9. </sup>Because the JIT will have to keep fairly detailed
    dependency information to implement this feature, we will also
    probably provide a way to browse that information. Then the user can
    check for semantic consistency between callers and callees after
    making changes, even in code that is syntactically consistent.</p>
