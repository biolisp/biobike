This directory contains various third party libraries that are used by
the BioLisp project. (N.B. In a perfect world the cl-ppcre library
that lives in the top-level ppcre/ directory would be moved in
here. However, due to CVS lossage, this is seen as being not worth the
hassle so it will get grandfathered in in it's current location.)

For libraries that are loaded with ASDF, add a (register ...)
expression in load.lisp to register the library directories containing
.asd files.

If for some reason you need to change any of this code, please try to
send a patch to the upstream author so we will be able to accept new
versions from them down the line.
