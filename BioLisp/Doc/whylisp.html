The question that we are most frequently asked by engineers and computer scientists is: <i>"Why did you base
BioBike on Lisp, instead of some 'modern' programming language, like
C/C++, Java, PERL, or Python; Isn't Lisp an archaic, dead, and anyway
impossibly complex programming language?"</i> 

<p>

First, Lisp is far from archaic or dead!  Although it is one of the
oldest programming languages (invented in the early 1960s, along with
Fortran!), it is still widely used in the Artificial Intelligence
community, and is the first programming language taught in intro
computer science courses at many top universities, including MIT and
Berkeley. (Actually, what's taught is usually Scheme, a dialect of
Lisp; Common Lisp can be thought of as an industrial form of Scheme.)

<p>

Lisp is also the <i>only</i> programming language with certain very
useful features, such as true macros, that are
<i>critical</i> when you are inventing a new programming language,
like BioBike, because they enable you to extend Lisp's syntax<sup>1</sup>.  Lisp
is the most natural language in which to write complex 'symbolic
reasoning' programs, which are the heart of BioBike's novel
capabilities.  Symbolic reasoning involves manipulating conceptual
objects, such as 'genes', 'ontologies', 'pathway models', and the
like, and Lisp was built specifically for this sort of manipulation
(although not specifically for biology at the time).  This is why it
has remained popular in the most advanced computing circles, esp. in
Artificial Intelligence.

<p>  

As for being impossibly complex, it's not any more complex than any
other programming language.  (Those who don't know Chinese think it's
hard too, but the Chinese don't!)  Many other 'modern' programming
languages have been based directly on Lisp; Python, for example, is
just a near approximation to Lisp.  (See Peter Norvig's comparison <a
href=http://www.norvig.com/python-lisp.html>here</a>.)  One of us
(Shrager) teaches Lisp to both programmers and non-programmers
regularly.  Lisp is often taught to non-programmers because it has
very simple syntax (requiring only the balancing of parentheses), and
deals naturally with complex symbolic computations (as above), so
musicians, writers, and others who want to write programs that deal
with complex structured knowledge find Lisp easy and powerful.  We
think that biologists will as well.

<p>

As for C/C++/Java, those languages are of a very different sort than
Lisp and Python (and to a large extent PERL). Lisp, et al., are
essentially interactive programming languages; You write small concise
programs that do small concise things, and test them in small concise
ways.  C and friends are designed for writing large,
industrial-strength programs, and have lots of features -- such as
required type declarations -- that make them
run FAST, but which at the same time make them difficult to use for
small, concise applications.  (Lisp, by the way, is no slouch in the
area of speed! It has decades of excellent compiler development
underneath that makes well-written Lisp code run at nearly the speed
of C (better than half as fast, in many cases).  Of course,
you can write a slow program in <i>any</i> programming language!
Also, as pattern matching is a big thing these days, it's interesting
to note that a PERL-compatible pattern matcher written entirely in
Lisp is as fast as, and in some cases <i>faster</i> than, the PERL
pattern matcher itself!  Code and comparisons <a
href=http://www.weitz.de/cl-ppcre/>here</a>.)  We use this pattern
matcher.

<p>

Bottom line: Why Lisp?  <i>Because it's the right language for the
job!</i>

Notes:

<p>

1. Python, which is more-or-less lisp w/o the parens, is missing
several critical features to do what we do in BioBike, esp. true
macros, which enable you to manipulate expressions, create sub
langauages, and engage in applicative programming. Someday the Python
crowd will realize that uniform syntax is a good thing, and will
re-adopt parens (or something like them), and then Python will just be
Lisp again, and much the better for it!
