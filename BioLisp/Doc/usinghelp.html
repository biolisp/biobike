<p>
<br>
<big>The main help command is, unsurprisingly, called "help" !</big>

<pre>
  >> (help)
</pre>

or just plain

<pre>
  >> help
</pre>

and it gets you

<pre>
Email support: biobike@lists.stanford.edu
Use the 'Documentation' link at the bottom of the page for more help,
  site search capabilities and tutorials.
HELP usage:
  (help "a string") -- find functions related to the string
  (help a-symbol) -- print documentation for the symbol
For detailed information on help itself, type: (help help)
and click on the 'HELP' link to see the full HELP documentation.
</pre>

<p>

If you type (help help) you'll get:

<p>
<pre>
HELP	(&OPTIONAL THING &REST ARGS)
  Usage: (help THING ARGS) If THING names a Biobike primitive exactly, the ...
</pre>

With the word HELP hyperlinked.  If you click on it you'll see the
entire description of the Biobike HELP function, along with the
source code that implements it.
<p>
Let's try some help searches:

<p>
<font color=green><i>
(Your specific results may vary from the results in these examples
because the system may well have changed since this documentation was
last updated.)
</i></font>

<p>

;; There are 17 related symbols not shown. Use, for example:
;; (help "ORGANISM" :all t) to see them all.
;; (help "ORGANISM" :simlimit 0.33) to see more entries.
;; (help "ORGANISM" :upto 10) to see at most 10.
;; For more info on help itself, type: (help help)
;; and click on HELP to show its full documentation.
</pre>

<p>

You get a list of functions and variables in the Biobike system
which have something to do with 'ORGANISM', and for each such symbol,
the function's argument list (or the variable's value) and the initial
part of its documentation description.  Each symbol so listed is also
hyperlinked and if you click on the link you'll get a complete
description of the function, along with source code, or more
information about the variable.  You also gets hints on how to use
the HELP command to limit or expand the number of entries displayed.
<p>

Now let's see the help on a specific function, load-organism:

<p>
<pre>
  >> (help load-organism)
::
LOAD-ORGANISM	(ORGANISM &KEY RELOAD? ORGANISM-INFO? GE...)
  Load information from the database about an organism into memory. 
Creates genome frames for each contig of the organism, and possibly 
gene, transcript and protein frames if these tables exist in 
the database.  Modifies *loaded-organisms* appropriately.
</pre>

By querying for a specific function you get the entire documentation
description, as well as its argument list and a link to display to
you the source code for the function.  From that display, you can
look at the entire file the function is defined it, or get a directory
listing of all the files in the same directory.
<p>

What happens if we give help a vague description of what we want?

<pre>
   >> (help "load an organism")
:: 
LOAD-ORGANISM	(ORGANISM &KEY RELOAD? ORGANISM-INFO? GE...)
  Load information from the database about an organism into memory. Creates ...
*LOADED-ORGANISMS*	(#$anabaena_variabilis_atcc29413 #$anaba...
  All organisms currently available to Biobike. See LOAD-ORGANISM for how...
CANONICALIZE-ORGANISM-DESIGNATOR	(ORGD &KEY MUST-BE-LOADED? LOAD?)

CANONICALIZE-LOADED-ORGANISM-DESIGN...	(ORGD)
  Convert an organism designator to a loaded organism's frame.
MEME	(OBJECTS &KEY NMOTIFS SAFE?)
  (meme <list-of-sequenceable-things> [:nmotifs 3])) calls the MEME program ...
</pre>
   
As you see, we find functions and variables with either "load" or
"organism" (or both!) in them, and another entry, MEME, which the matching
algorithm thinks might be related to what you are asking for.

<p>

There are a number of other important ways to get help in Biobike
just using commands.  HELP-LISP is a function which will print out
Common Lisp symbols that match your input, and there are the Common Lisp
functions APROPOS, APROPOS-LIST, and DESCRIBE.
<p>
APROPOS is a lot like HELP-LISP, while DESCRIBE will print out a
description of any object you give it:

<pre>
  >> (describe :fred)
:: 
:FRED is a NEW SYMBOL.
  Its value is :FRED
  It is globally declared to be a constant.
  It is EXTERNAL in the KEYWORD package.

  >> (describe 1000000000000000)
:: 
1000000000000000 is a NEW BIGNUM.
 It is 50 bits wide
</pre>

You can read more about them in the
<a target=_blank
href=http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm>Common
Lisp Hyperspec</a>.  Here's the entry for <a target=_blank
href=http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_apropo.htm>
APROPOS</a>, and here's the one for <a target=_blank
href=http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_descri.htm>
DESCRIBE</a>

<p>

Now, we've mentioned that the names of the functions in the
foregoing are all marked as hyperlinks.  That is, you can click
through them to something.  I wonder what it could be?

<p>

Let's try clicking through a function.  If you have access to the Biobike
system, click on LOAD-ORGANISM.  All sort of interesting things appear:

<ul>
<li> The argument list
<li> The name of the source file containing LOAD-ORGANISM, clickable
<li> The name of the source directory, clickable
<li> The documentation for LOAD-ORGANISM
<li> The source code listing 
</ul>

<p> But that's not all!  The source code listing itself contains
clickable items, which are the names of functions and macros that
LOAD-ORGANISM calls.  Some of these are standard Lisp functions <font
color=purple>(in purple)</font>, and some of them are Biobike primitives
<font color=green>(in green)</font>

<p>

You can look at the source file by clicking on its name; the same
purple and green links will appear along with the complete file.

<p>

You can look at a simple listing of the source directory, and from there
examine other source files in the directory or other higher-level or
sub-directories.

<hr>

<p> Besides HELP, another means of viewing what Biobike primitives
are available is through the 'Bio Primitives' link near the
bottom of the Listener.

<p> 

This will give you a list of categories, which you can click into
('+' or '*') to get a listing of primitives in that category.  Or you
can click on the 'alphabetical listing' link near the top of the page
to get a listing of all the Biobike primitives.

<hr>

<p>
Finally, you can always email the Biobike support team with
your questions if you get stuck.
