MOST OF THIS HAS BEEN MOVED INTO A TUTORIAL; THE ONLY REMAINING INFO
IS INTERNAL NOTES FOR BIOBIKE SUPPORT.

<h3>Installing SNARK in your BioBike Server</h3>

Snark is setup as a BioBike <i>MODULE</i>. The simplest was to set it
up is to just copy the whole module directory from an existing BioBike
server. You can find out where that is by evaluating 

<pre>  (find-module :snark)</pre> 

in a server that already has it.  This will return something like:

<pre>
#P"/home/BioDemo/snark/load.lisp"
:DIRECTORY
("/home/BioDemo/" #P"/home/BioDemo/visitors/jshrager/"
 #P"/usr/local/biolisp/" #P"/usr/local/BioLisp/lib/"
 #P"/usr/local/BioLisp/Lib/" #P"/usr/local/BioLisp/"
 #P"/home/BioDemo/visitors/shared-files/")
</pre>

Indicating that the relevant subdirectory is (in this case)
/home/BioDemo/snark/load.lisp. If you just copy over that whole
subdirectory to the analogous place in your new server, then

<pre>
  (use-module :snark)
</pre>

should now work on your new server.

<p>

(On Nostoc, the main BioBike server, everything is actually in
/usr/local/biotools/snark, and then each individual server has a
symbolic link from the "virtual" location in their home directories,
to that central location.)

<p>

If you need to setup SNARK from scratch, first download it from
SRI. SNARK info, including where to get the current code, is here:

<pre>
  http://www.ai.sri.com/~stickel/snark.html
</pre>

!!! IMPORTANT::: When you get a new release make sure that you compile
it by adding the optional t arg to (make-snark-system) in load.lisp,
and then removing it.  (Or just do the right thing by hand.)

  (load "snark-system.lisp")
  (make-snark-system t)

<p>

(You might have to remove the export of #:it from snark-pkg.lisp
because it appears to be breaking the server upon use-module. We
don't know why.)

<p>

Create a "load.lisp" file in the snark directory that looks something like:

<pre>
(in-package :cl-user)
(load "/usr/local/biotools/snark/current/snark-system.lisp")
(make-snark-system)
</pre>

Create a unix symbolic link in the ../snark directory to the latest
version top directory, and call the link "current". (The snark top
directory usually has a date format, as: "snark-20031012f".)

You'll need to dyke out these lines from make-snark-system in
snark-system.lisp:

<pre>
;  (setf *package* (find-package :snark-user))
;  (setf *print-pretty* nil)
</pre>

In src/useful.lisp, 

In the function INITIALIZE-HASH-DOLLAR-READER you'll find these two similar lines:

<pre>
(set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\$ #'hash-dollar-reader *hash-dollar-readtable*)
(set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\$ #'hash-dollar-reader)
</pre>

Comment out the SECOND one:

<pre>
;   (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\$ #'hash-dollar-reader)
</pre>

In snark-system.lisp comment out the load entry for "cycl" (in the long list
of loaded modules).

<p>

You'll also need an auxilliary code from the BioBike system in a file
called "biosnark.lisp", which you can get from the BioBike sources.

<p>

Snark should now compile normally, and you can go on to the top of
this lesson.
