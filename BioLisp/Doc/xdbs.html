<p>

(This module is not complete, in part because the tools for
interaction with external knowledge bases are an ongoing project.)

<p>


BioBike can easily extract knowledge from external knowledge bases,
like PubMed, which conform to a special knowledge-communication
standard called "XML".  Later, we'll see how to write our own code to
interact with external knowledge bases that speak XML, but for now,
let's look at the tools that are already available in BioBike.

<p>

<h3>Searching PubMed (the easy version)</h3>

<p>

Let's try an example to get right into it:

<pre>
  >> (pubmed-query "biolingua")
  :: (#$pubmed-result140 #$pubmed-result141)

  >> (setq results *)        ; Sset that into a variable for later use.
</pre>



Notice that we got back a list containing two frames.  If you examine
those (by clicking on them), you'll see that each represents a
different paper, one in 2004 and the other in 2002 (the #^year slot
tells us the publiaction year).  The authors are buried one more layer
deep.  We can get them either by clicking, or prgrammatically, for example:

<pre>
  >> (loop for result in results 
           collect (loop for author in (#^author result)
                    collect (#^lastname author)))
  :: (("Shrager" "Elhai" "Travers" "Massar")
      ("Pohorille" "Langley" "Shrager"))
</pre>

Notice that we had to use a double loop: one to go through the
articles (each seaprate #$pubmed-result), and one to go through the
authors in each article.  And, as one would expect, we got back an
author list for each article.

<p>

Let's actually make that a function for later use:

<pre>
  >> (defun extract-authors (pm-results)
       (loop for result in pm-results 
             collect (loop for author in (#^author result)
                      collect (#^lastname author))))
</pre>

<p>

The PUBMED-QUERY function has a few useful arguments.  Let's try
something a little more likely to have a lot of results:

<pre>
  >> (pubmed-query "smith")
  :: (#$pubmed-result145 #$pubmed-result146 #$pubmed-result147)
</pre>

What?! Only three papers with SMITH in their names?  It turns out that
the function only returns up to three hits.  But this is easy to change:

<pre>
  >> (pubmed-query "smith" :return-n 100)
  ::  (#$pubmed-result148 #$pubmed-result149 #$pubmed-result150
       #$pubmed-result151 #$pubmed-result152 #$pubmed-result153
       #$pubmed-result154 #$pubmed-result155 #$pubmed-result156
       #$pubmed-result157 #$pubmed-result158 #$pubmed-result159
       ...etc...

  >> (extract-authors *)
  :: (("Perry" "Smith" "Cash" "Zhu" "Aliev" "Siedlak" "Moreira")
      ("Smith" "Krauthamer")
      ("Perry" "Smith" "Zhua" "Moreira" "Honda" "Nunomura" "Siedlak" "Xie" "Liu")
      ("Folsom" "Smith" "Weitzman" "Bell" "Sorlie" "Chambless" "Rosamond")
      ("Mitchell" "Dowson" "Clarke" "Smith" "Jefferies")
      ...etc...
</pre>
Ah, much better! 

<p>

Now, suppose you wanted a paper that you know exists by Smith and
Jones, about musculoskeletal services in northwest Wales.  You could,
in principle, run a query on "smith", and another on "jones", and
another on "wales" and yet another on "musculoskeletal", and put
:return-n 100000 on each (to make sure you got back every possible
paper for each), and then integrate the results using complex
intersections on the paper ID, or some such thing.  But that would be
impossibly complex, and anyway, pubmed does all that work for us.  All
we need to do is:

<pre>
  >> (pubmed-query '("smith" "jones" "musculoskeletal" "Wales"))
  :: (#$pubmed-result251)

Hey, cool, just one paper; Let's see if it's the one we want:

  >> (#^articletitle (first *))    ; FIRST because notice that the result is a list!
  :: "Improved access and targeting of musculoskeletal services in northwest Wales: targeted early access to musculoskeletal services (TEAMS) programme."
</pre>

Tada!
