<h3><center>Collaboration</center></h3>
<p>
The easiest way to collaborate with a fellow BioLingua user is to have both of you
log in to one or the other of your accounts.  Coupled with a telephone, this 
provides one of you with a way of watching what the other person is doing and
the other of you with a way to do something and have your colleague watch what you 
are doing while you are verbally explaining  what you are doing.
<p>
If you are the person in control of the action, once you've typed an expression
and gotten a result back, tell your colleague to refresh his WebListener browser 
window.  He will then immediately see what you've typed and the result. 
<p>
This technique is especially valuable when used for mentoring and can also be 
used for remote debugging.  

<h3><center>Sharing code</center></h3>
<p>
There are a number of ways of sharing code among BioLingua users.  These include
simply using a function someone else has written, loading a file of BioLingua     
code another user has saved, and using the 'module system.' 
<p>
Suppose you have written a function: 
<pre>
(defun magicword () "XYZZY")
</pre>
and you are enamored enough with this function that you would like someone else
to use it.  That's very easy.  Suppose you are logged in with the user name
FRED, and your buddy is logged in as BARNEY.  For BARNEY to use your MAGICWORD
function, all he has to do is type: 
<pre>
(fred::magicword)
</pre>
This will work as long as a) You have defined the function and b) The BioLingua
system has not been rebooted since you defined the function.  (If it has been
rebooted, then in order for either of you to use it, you'll have to define it 
again.)
<p>
A more permanent mechanism is to use the BioLingua editor to save your 
functions to a file in your BioLingua home directory.  Then your colleagues
can access this file themselves.  For instance, if you create a file
called mystuff.lisp in your BioLingua home directory, then others can view that
file by using the 'Browse BioFiles' link from the main WebListener page.
One of the links on the page brought up by this link is a directory 
called something like  '/home/visitors/' or '/home/biovcu/users/'.
Clicking on this link will show a listing of the home directories of all 
BioLingua users.  Further clicking in a similar vein will get your colleague
to the mystuff.lisp file that you have saved.  
<p>
Another place to put files you want to share is the shared directory which 
can also be accessed from the top-level links of the Browse BioFiles page.  
<p>
The best way to share code, however, is to use the BioLingua module system. 
This allows you to save out a set of function and variable definitions to a 
file in a format that will allow your colleagues to easily load and use the code
you have written.  
<p>
<b>The Module System</b>
<p>
The module system is composed of the following functions:
<ul>
<li> LOAD-MODULE </li>
<li> USE-MODULE </li>
<li> CREATE-LOADABLE-MODULE </li>
</ul>
The CREATE-LOADABLE-MODULE function is what you use to create your module.
You give it a module name, a list of functions, and optionally a list of 
variables.
<p>
It then creates a file in the shared directory whose name is the name 
you provided with a .lisp extension.  
<p>
To use this code, a colleague need only then type:
<pre>
(load-module :module-name)
</pre>
(The LOAD-MODULE command automatically calls the USE-MODULE function)
<p>
The reason this mechanism is preferable to all others is that it avoids
what are known as 'package problems.'  These occur when two functions or
variables are accidentally given the same name and then you try to
have access to both at once.  The module mechanism goes out of its way to
insure that these kinds of problems do not occur.  
<p>
Another thing the module mechanism does is to allow the user of a module
not to have to prefix the names of functions he wants to use.  Recall above that
your colleague had to type fred::magicword instead of just magicword.
If you had used the module system, your colleague could have accessed the 
magicword function without using the 'fred::' prefix.
<p>
<b> Module System Example </b>
<p>
Suppose you have defined two functions, F1 and F2, and a variable V1. 
<pre>
(defparameter V1 23)
(defun F1 (x) (+ 1 x))
(defun F2 (x) (+ 2 x))
</pre>
Now you wish to create a module with these definitions in it called 
<b>fredstuff</b>.
Executing
<pre>
(create-loadable-module :fredstuff '(F1 F2) :variable-list '(V1))
</pre>
will create the module, creating the file fredstuff.lisp in the shared 
directory.  
<p>
Your colleague, Barney, then simply needs to type:
<pre>
(load-module :fredstuff)
(use-module :fredstuff)
</pre>
Once he does this, he can then use F1, F2, and V1.  e.g., 
<pre>
(F1 3)
4
</pre>
