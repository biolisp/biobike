<h2> <center> The BioBike Language (BBL) Description </center> </h2>
<br>
<h3> Introduction </h3>

The Biobike Language (hereafter BBL) is a computer language written
for biologists.  Its goals are 1) to provide readable computer code to
the perusing biologist who is not necessarily familiar with computer
languages or computer concepts, and 2) provide capability for a
biologist interested in investigating bioinformatics-type questions
about their data to do so via writing computer programs which are
straightforward and intuitive, using concepts from biology and the
smallest amount of computer-algorithm knowledge possible.

<p>

BBL is based on Common Lisp, while its syntax is a bit different, its
semantics more flexible, and its error messages more understandable.

<h3> New syntax </h3>
The new syntax that BBL introduces is: 
<br>
<ul> 
<li> Bracket notation, [ ], used to access and set substructure.  </li>
<li> The symbol ->, used within brackets, to denote ranges of indices. </li>
<li> Curly brace notation, { }, used as shorthand for (list ...) </li>
<li> Periods within symbols causing symbols to be interpreted as frames,
 e.g., FOO.BAR denoting the frame #$FOO.BAR </li>
</ul>
<p>
An example of this notation: 
<p>
<code> 
<font color="brown"> <b> (setf foo.bar[.slot1] {1 2 3}) </b> </font>
</code>
<p>
  -- 'foo.bar' represents the frame #$foo.bar.  
<br>
  -- '.slot1' represents the frame #$slot1.  
<br>
  -- 'foo.bar[.slot1]' is equivalent semantically to 
<p>
<code> 
<font color="brown"> <b> (slotv #$foo.bar #$slot1) </b> </font>
</code>

<p>	

  -- and {1 2 3} is equivalent to (list 1 2 3).  

<p>

Therefore the above expression sets the #$slot1 slot of the frame #$foo.bar
to the list (1 2 3).

<p>

Another example using -> notation: 

<p>

<code>
<font color="brown"> <b> "abcdefghijklm"[-> 2 5 -> 7 9 ->] </b> </font>
</code>

<p>

  -- '-> 2' represents the set of indices 1 2
 <br>
  -- '5 -> 7' represents the set of indices 5 6 7
 <br>
  -- '9 ->' represents the set of indices 9 10 11 12 13 in this case; in general
it represents the indices from 9 through the last legal index.  

<p>

The result of the above operation is "abefgijklm"

<p>

In BBL, all symbols with '.' in them denote frames.  It is impossible
to have a symbol with a '.' as one of its characters; the compiler
will simply translate the symbol into an appropriate frame.  Symbols
whose first character is '.' are translated into a frame whose name
is the symbol's name without the initial '.' .   A symbol with a '.'
somewhere in the middle is translated into a frame whose name 
is the same as the symbol's name -- the '.' is NOT removed.   


<h3> New semantics </h3>

BBL introduces the following new semantics: 

<ul>

<li> Symbols as frames

<li> 1-based indexing

<li> Range notation within [ ]s for sequences, with the range values
indicating inclusive ranges; also range notation denoting a range from
the beginning of a sequence to a particular index and from an index to
the end of the sequence; also multiple independent indices within [ ]s
for sequences.  

<li> Strings of length 1 in place of characters

<li> Deprecation of characters in favor of one-length strings

<li> DEFINE-FUNCTION, an alternative to DEFUN

<li> DEFCONVERSION, sophisticated argument coercion within DEFINE-FUNCTION

<li> A revised LOOP facility

<li> Inability to use FUNCALL or APPLY on BBL functions
defined with DEFINE-FUNCTION.  

</ul>

<h4> Symbols as Frames </h4>

BBL introduces the concept of certain symbols (without '.' as a
character) as frames.  In any given BBL instantiation there are a
set of non-dotted symbols that, unless lexically shadowed, refer to
frames.  The determination of which symbols refer to frames and to
which frames is a complicated algorithm, defined by the function
BIOBIKE-INTERNALS::IN-BIOBIKE-FRAME-MAPPING?.

<p>

This function uses the BIOBIKE-INTERNALS::*BIOBIKE-FRAME-MAPPING*
hash table, the names and nicknames of existing organisms, and the
prefixes for the genes, proteins, and contiguous sequences of each
organism, to make a determination as to whether a symbol denotes a
frame.  

<p> 

An example: The symbol sef0012 denotes a frame in the Cyanobacterial
instances of BBL because there is a gene named #$s7942.sef0012 and
the string "S7942" is the prefix for the organism denoted by the
organism frame #$synechococcus_elongatus_pcc7942.  Any use of the
sef0012 symbol (unless it is lexically bound) is as if the symbol
evaluated to the #$s7942.sef0012 frame.

<p>

Note: It is expected that different BBL installations will have
different requirements as to which symbols denote frames, and
therefore the above-mentioned function and hash table will need to be
redefined.

<h4> 1-based indexing </h4>

BBL reintroduces (a la Fortran) the notion of 1-based indexing,
instead of 0-based as is done in Common Lisp.  To index the first element
of an array A in Common Lisp, one would write: 

<p>

<code>
<font color="brown"> <b> (aref a 0) </b> </font>
</code>

<p>

while to index the first element of an array A in BBL, one writes:

<p>

<code>
<font color="brown"> <b> a[1] </b> </font> 
or 
<font color="brown"> <b> (ref a 1) </b> </font> 
</code>


<p>

This notion of 1-based indexing extends to results returned by other
functions such as the BBL equivalents Common Lisp's sequence
functions.

<p>

<font color="red"> Note: A BBL user using a Common Lisp function
that either uses indices (such as LISP:SUBSEQ) or returns a position
(such as LISP:SEARCH) will have to adjust the index or position by
subtracting or adding 1, respectively.
</font>

<h4> Range notation, etc. </h4>

ARROW NOTATION: Within [ ]s indexing sequences, BBL allows the use of
'->'.  This notation may be used between two indices, in which case it
indicates a range of indices from the first index to the second index,
inclusive.  The first index may be greater than the second index, in
which case the indices are enumerated backwards.  The '->' may also be
used as the first index, if so, it indicates a range from index 1 to
the second index (it is simply a shorthand notation for '1 -> x' at
the start of the indices list).  Finally, the '->' may be used as the
last index, if so, it indicates a range from the previous index to the
last, highest index, inclusive.

<p>

Examples of -> notation:

<p>

<code>
<ul> 
<li> "abcdefgh"[3 -> 6] --> "def"  ; a standard range.  </li>
<li> "abcdefgh"[-> 4] --> "abcd"   ; an initial range. </li>
<li> "abcdefgh"[4 ->] --> "defgh"  ; a final range. </li>
<li> "abcdefgh"[7 -> 4] --> "gfed" ; a reverse range. </li>
<li> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"[-> 2 4 6 -> 8 10 11 14 ->] -->
	"abdfghjknopqrstuvwxyz" ; a complicated set of indices and ranges </li>
</ul>	
</code>

<p>

More examples of -> notation in assignment.  Assume x is
the list (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10) and gets reassigned to this value
for each example below: 

<p>

<code>
<ul>
<li> (setf x[3 -> 6] '(a b c d)) ; now x = (1 2 a b c d 7 8 9 10) </li>
<li> (setf x[6 -> 4] '(a b c))   ; now x = (1 2 3 c b a 7 8 9 10) </li>
</ul>
</code>

<p>

<font color="red"> Note: range notation will only work for sequences;
it will not work for hash tables, frames or multi-dimensional arrays.
</font>

<p>

MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT INDICES: Within [ ]s indexing sequences, 
BBL allows the use of multiple indices, indicating that values 
at each index position will be extracted and concatenated together. 

<p>

Examples of using independent indices:

<p>

<code>
<ul>
<li> "abcdefghijklmnop"[1 4 2 10] --> "adbj" </li>
<li> '(a b c d e f g h i j k)[6 6 5 1 1] --> (f f e a a) </li>
</ul>
</code>

<p>

<font color="red"> Note: multiple indices notation will work for everything
but multiply-dimensioned arrays, where the multiple indices are interpreted as
specifying a single element of the multiple-dimensioned array.  
</font>

<p>


<h4> Characters replaced by strings of length one </h4>

BBL deprecates the use of characters; while in Common Lisp the
result of extracting the first element of the string "abc" is #\a, in
BBL the result is "a", a string of length 1.  Similarly, one can
store a string of length 1 into a particular position of another
string.  Common Lisp characters are not, however, verboten -- if one
attempts to store a Common Lisp character into a string in BBL
nothing inappropriate will happen:

<p>		

<code>
<pre>
<font color="brown"> 
(setq x "abc")
(setf x[2] #\z) 
(setf x[3] "y")
x --> "azy"
</pre>
</font>
</code>

<h4> Define-function </h4>

DEFINE-FUNCTION is a new utility for defining procedures in BBL.
(DEFUN still works in BBL as in Common Lisp; DEFINE-FUNCTION
provides various extensions.)

<p>

DEFINE-FUNCTION is specified fully in the file .../bike/define-function.txt.
Here is a summary of its main features:

<ul> 

<li> Handling of keyword arguments such that they need not be specified in
a call using ':' (i.e., as keyword symbols), but can be specified using any
symbol in any package whose symbol-name matches the symbol name of the
keyword parameter.

<li> Allowing keywords to have aliases.  

<li> Allowing syntactic tokens (words that make a call seem more
English like, and/or optionally appear in a specific place between
required arguments.  These token variables are like flag variables
(see below) but they must appear in a specific place.)

<li> "Flag" arguments--keyword arguments that take no subsequent
value but are simply present or not (and their value is T or NIL.)

<li> Allowing aliases for the function name

<li> Specification of argument types and return value (using syntax
simpler than DECLARE syntax) 

<li> Runtime checking of argument types and generation of meaningful
error messages.

<li> Runtime coercion of arguments by type.

<li> Implicit mapping of required arguments declared atomic but given
as lists.

<li> Declaration of local variables (equivalent to &aux or initial
LET) using simple syntax

<li> Retained ability to define simple functions simply using a
DEFUN-like syntax.

<li> Allowing, but not requring, various kinds of documentation such
as a summary string, a documentation string, examples, and see-also
references (which will get passed through to the DOCUMENT-FUNCTION
macro).

<li> Provision to allow export of the symbol being defined from the
Biobike package.

<li> Automatically generating documentation of allowed argument types. 

</ul>

DEFINE-FUNCTION has a very different look and feel from DEFUN.  Here
is a small example:

<code>
<pre>
<font color="brown"> 
(define-function search-for 
	required (element (in within) seq)
	keyword (start = 1)
	type (seq = lisp:sequence start = lisp:fixnum)
	summary "Finds the position of the first occurrence of ELEMENT in SEQ."
	body (loop for j from start to (length seq)
	            when (equal element (ref seq j))
	            (return j)
                    ))
</font>
</pre>
</code>

Instead of a single argument list, DEFINE-FUNCTION provides
independent specifications for each kind of argument: required and
keyword arguments, as in Common Lisp, and two new argument types,
token and flag arguments.  BBL does not allow Common Lisp's &optional
or &rest argument types.  Instead of type declaration statements
within the body of a definition the user uses TYPE clauses, which
additionally guarantee that the argument type will be checked (when
safety is enabled, as defined by the *safety* variable being non-NIL).
Many other features as listed above are also available.

<h4> Defconversion </h4>

DEFINE-FUNCTION allows the user to do automatic coercion of input
arguments.  This is facilitated by BBL's DEFCONVERSION facility.
DEFCONVERSION allows the user (or the system administrator for a BBL
instantiation) to define a default conversion from one type to
another, and a set of named conversions in addition to the default
from the one type to the other.  Here is an example of DEFCONVERSION
interacting with DEFINE-FUNCTION:

<code>
<pre>
<font color="brown"> 
;; define a default conversion from floating point to integer, and 
;; two alternative methods 
(defconversion (single-float to integer) (f) (round f))
(defconversion (single-float to integer :named fceiling) (f) (ceiling f))
(defconversion (single-float to integer :named ftruncate) (f) (truncate f))  

(define-function foo
	required (float1 float2)
	convert float1 from single-float to integer
	convert float2 from single-float to integer using fceiling
	body (list float1 float2)
	)

(foo 1.4 1.3) 
--> (1 2)
</font>
</pre>
</code>

Note: If no DEFCONVERSION method has been defined and the user
specifies that an argument is to be converted to a particular type,
then the Common Lisp function COERCE is called to do this conversion.

<h4> Loop facility </h4>

The new BBL loop facility is designed to remedy some of the more 
obnoxious features and flaws of Common Lisp's loop facility.  

<p>

The BBL loop facility is more completely described in
.../doc/loop-syntax.txt.  Some of the more interesting features of the
new loop facility are:

<ul> 

<li> The ability to loop over lists, arrays, strings, hash tables, 
garrays and frames using a standard syntax; in LISP:LOOP the way one 
iterates over a list is different than how one iterates over a vector
and both are different than how one iterates over a hash table!  

<li> The ability to leave out the 'DO' before the body of the loop.
This is one of the most common errors made by people using LISP:LOOP,
even by very experienced programmers.

</ul>

The BBL loop facility imposes significant restrictions compared to
LISP:LOOP's syntax and semantics.  Some of these restrictions are:

<ul>

<li> Variable initialization clauses (which in LISP:LOOP begin with
the word 'WITH,' while in BBL begin with the word 'INIT') are
required to occur before any other loop clauses.

<li> No collection into variables is allowed; only a single COLLECT
can be specified.  

<li> The token 'IF' as toplevel control structure within the body of
the loop is not allowed; only 'WHEN' and 'UNLESS' are allowed.  

<li> No INITIALLY clauses are allowed.  

</ul> 

Note: LISP:LOOP is a very complicated macro, both syntactically and
semantically.  There are many of LISP:LOOP's features not specifically
listed above that are not implemented in BBL's LOOP.

<p>

Here is an example of BBL's loop in action:
<font color="brown"> 
<code>
<pre>
(defparameter ht (utils:create-hash-table '((a 1) (b 2) (c 3))))

(loop init (x y) = {"abc" "def"} 
      for (key value) in ht
      for j fixnum from 1 
      (print (list j key value x[j] y[(- 4 j)]))
      finally (return "all done!"))
      
(1 B 2 "a" "f") 
(2 A 1 "b" "e") 
(3 C 3 "c" "d") 
"all done!"
</font>
</pre>
</code>

<h4> FUNCALL and APPLY unusable with DEFINE-FUNCTION </h4>

BBL functions defined with DEFINE-FUNCTION <font color="red"> <i>
cannot </i> </font> be used as arguments to FUNCALL, APPLY, or other
functions expecting functions as arguments.  This is because BBL
functions are actually defined as lisp macros; this is spelled out in
more detail in the DEFINE-FUNCTION document.  (A user can use a Common
Lisp LAMBDA construct to get around this restriction.)

<h3> Special Operators </h3>

The list of Lisp special operators available to BBL is still under
construction; The current list is specified in .../bike/symbols.lisp.
a
<h3> Macros </h3>

The list of Lisp macros available to BBL is still under construction; 
The current list is specified in .../bike/symbols.lisp.

<h3> Functions </h3>

The list of Lisp functions available to BBL is still under construction; 
The current list is specified in .../bike/symbols.lisp.

<h3> BBL specific variables, functions and macros. </h3>

The set of BBL specific symbols is maintained in .../bike/bbl-package.lisp


<h3> Miscellaneous </h3>

BBL is designed to be user-friendly.  Much work went into attempting
to make the error messages it itself produces clear.  Sometimes this
means the messages are quite verbose!  Still, the BBL language does
not have control over all possible error messages a user might
encounter -- many are still generated by the underlying Lisp system
while others are generated by functions written in BBL and made part
of the BioBike system.

<p>

BBL maintains a user-level stack trace so that when an error occurs an
informative flow of control report is generated.  Unlike Common Lisp
this stack trace report contains system and user-defined macros.

<p>

BBL only does extensive runtime checking and maintenance of its own
flow of control stack when it executes in safe mode.  Safe mode is on
by default, and can be disabled (or reenabled) by executing

<p>

<font color="brown"> <code> (setq *safety* nil) </code> </font>
<br>
<font color="brown"> <code> (setq *safety* t) </code> </font>

<p>

respectively.

<p>

Currently a user enters the BBL system (as opposed to the
Biolisp system) by executing: 

<p>

<font color="brown"> <code> (bbl) </code> </font>

<p>

Note: A user may enter Biobike mode by default on logging in by 
placing the same form as above in his biolisp.ini file.

<p>

In order to load a file containing BBL code, the BBL function BBLOAD
must be used.  Attempts to load and/or compile files of BBL code using
LISP:LOAD / LISP:COMPILE-FILE will generally not work, or produce
strange error messages, or result in failure at runtime.  The BBLOAD
function both compiles and loads; there is no need for a BBL
equivalent of LISP:COMPILE and LISP:COMPILE-FILE.

<p>

The Common Lisp function EVAL will not work correctly when handed BBL
forms.  BBL forms are only guaranteed to work when evaluated from the
Weblistener in biobike mode, causing the BBL compiler to preprocess
the input form before handing it off to Lisp.

<h3> Credits </h3>

The BBL language was designed by a committee including Jeff Elhai,
Jeff Shrager, JP Massar, Peter Seibel, Mike Travers, and Mark
Slupesky.

<p>

The BBL language infrastructure was implemented by JP Massar and Mark
Slupesky.  JP Massar implemented BBL's loop facility.  Mark Slupesky
wrote many of the tests for DEFINE-FUNCTION.  Peter Seibel implemented
the DOCUMENT-FUNCTION facility (not specific to BBL, but as part of
the BBL language implementation effort).  Jeff Elhai, Arnaud Taton and
others are implementing the macros and functions that will constitute
the user-level interface to the language.
