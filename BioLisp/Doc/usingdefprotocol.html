<p align="right">Copyright (c) 2003 by <a
href="http://aracyc.stanford.edu/~jshrager/personal/index.html">Jeff
Shrager</a> and JP Massar</p>

<p>Defprotocol is a rather involved mechanism for doing something that
is conceptually simple: making something general (a program) out of a
set of specific instructions.  As such, it is best to start in right
away with an example, follow it with some discussion, and leave the
detailed specification for the documentation.
 
<p>Suppose we aren't quite sure of the BioLisp code to do good old
Pythagoras' sum of squares.  In standard mathmatical notation we want
to define f(x,y) = sqrt (x*x + y*y).  But how do we do that in Lisp?

<p>Since we don't have an X or a Y defined, we'll use concrete values
for our testing, namely 3 and 4.  Okay, we'll see if we can square
a number, by typing (* 3 3) into the Command Entry Box and looking
at the output when when hit ENTER.

<pre>
<5>> (* 3 3)
:: 9
</pre>

<p> Well, that worked.  And clearly we can square 4 as well:

<pre>
<6>> (* 4 4)
:: 16
</pre>

<p> Now we want to add our two results.  Notice the line number
that occurs in the output area every time we evaluate anything.
This is where it becomes significant!!

<pre>
<7>> (+ (hop 5) (hop 6))
:: 25
</pre>

<p> What on Earth ????  What is HOP ????  HOP stands for History-OutPut.
The History is the set of things you typed in (inputs) and the set of
results (outputs) you got back.  (HOP &lt;number&gt) says to get me the
result from line &lt;number&gt.  The result of line 5 was 9, and the result
of line 6 was 16, so (+ (HOP 5) (HOP 6)) is 16.  

<p>Ok, the last thing we need to do is take the square root and we're
done with our experimenting.

<pre>
<8>> (square-root *)
:: attempt to call `SQUARE-ROOT' which is an undefined function.
</pre>

<p>Ruh Roh.  I guess the function for taking the square root isn't
called square-root.  Who designed this language anyway?  A quick visit
to the <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">
Hyperspec </a> and a quick scan of the symbols beginning with 's'
tells us that the function is called 'sqrt'.

<pre>
<9>> (sqrt **)
:: 5.0
</pre>

<p> Note that '*' refers to the latest result, and likewise '**' refers
to the result previous to that.  You can probably guess what '***'
refers to.  (That's it though, 3 stars and you're out.)

<p> So we've figured out the steps necessary to honor Pythagoras.  Now
all we have to do is combine them and use variables instead of specific
numbers, and we'll be able to diagonalize anything!  What we need to do
is use two variables -- call them X and Y, in place of 3 and 4.  And
we need to have our program execute steps 5, 6, 7 and 9 from above
(leaving out our unfortunate, but understandable, error on line 8).

<p> Here we go (type this into the Expression Entry box and hit EVAL):

<pre>
<10>> (defprotocol pythag ((x :value 3) (y :value 4)) 
        (steps 5 6 7 9))
:: PYTHAG
</pre>

<p> This defines a new function PYTHAG, which accepts two arguments, X
and Y.  The symbol X is substituted for the value 3 in every line
(step) of the function, and the symbol Y is substituted for the value
4 likewise.  The function definition consists of the input code on
lines 5, 6, 7 and 9, but with the above substitutions made.  The result
of the function is the result of executing the last line.

<p> Effectively, we've defined a function which does, in Lispese,

<pre>
(sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))
</pre>

<p> We can see what the function 'really' looks like by using 
the SHOW-PROTOCOL primitive:

<pre>
<11>> (show-protocol 'pythag)
::
;; Protocol substitution function: 

(DEFUN PYTHAG (&KEY (Y NIL) (X NIL))
  (LET ($$::S19-RESULT $$::S20-RESULT $$::S21-RESULT $$::S23-RESULT)
    (DECLARE (IGNORABLE $$::S19-RESULT $$::S20-RESULT $$::S21-RESULT
              $$::S23-RESULT))
    (PROGN (SETQ $$::S19-RESULT (* X X)) (SETQ $$::S20-RESULT (* Y Y))
           (SETQ $$::S21-RESULT (+ $$::S19-RESULT $$::S20-RESULT))
           (SETQ $$::S23-RESULT (SQRT $$::S21-RESULT)))))

;; Original history lines used:
    Line 19:  (* 3 3)
    Line 20:  (* 4 4)
    Line 21:  (+ (HOP 19) (HOP 20))
    Line 23:  (SQRT **)

;; Original DEFPROTOCOL form:

(DEFPROTOCOL PYTHAG ((X :VALUE 3) (Y :VALUE 4)) (STEPS 19 20 21 23))
</pre>

<p> On second thought, maybe we don't want to know what it 'really'
looks like, because in fact it looks a lot like line noise, or at best the
output of a compiler, one not particularly designed to produce
human-readable code.

<p> What we really care about is whether it works, so let's try it out:

<pre>
<12>> (pythag 6 8)
:: Illegal keyword given: 6.
</pre>

<p> Sigh.  What's wrong now?  Well, DEFPROTOCOL is specified to create
a function which accepts keyword arguments, and keyword arguments
alone.  (It probably should be more flexible, but that would make it
even more complicated!).  So if it wants keywords, we are going to
have to give it keywords:

<pre>
<13>> (pythag :x 6 :y 8)
:: 10.0
</pre>

<p> Muy bien.  Pythagoras, were he still alive, would be proud.

<p> So how do you use this in a more practical, if less Grecian,
context?  Let's do something with a microarray table.

<pre>
<14>> (read-microarray-table "biol:data;hiharadat.tbl")
:: #&lt;COMMON-LISP-USER::TABLE-DATA @ #x728efea2&gt;
</pre>

<p> We read in a particular microarray table, taken from the infamous
Hihara data.  We'll see in a moment how to generalize so that we can
read in any file of microarray data we'd like.

<p>Let's figure out which of the genes in this table were stimulated
initially to a value of more than 2.0, save those genes away and
determine how many genes were so stimulated.

<pre>
<15>> (table-data-select * #'(lambda (v) (> (aref v 0) 2.0)) :return :geneid)
:: -- You should get a long list of genes here, which we won't reproduce --
<16>> (setq *query-genes* *)
:: -- The same long list of genes --
<17>> (length **)
:: 127
</pre>

So there are 127 genes in the table who's first data point is greater
than 2.0.  This seems somewhat useful, but needs to be generalized.
We'd like to be able to ask this question of any table, and we'd like
to ask the question about any data point, not just the first one.
Here's a defprotocol definition that (almost) does this generalization
(we'll explain it in just a minute):

<pre>
<17>> (defprotocol stimulated-genes 
          (((table "biol:data;hiharadat.tbl") :line 14 :position 2) 
           ((datapoint 0) :line 15 :value 0)))
        (steps 14 15 16 17)
:: Position 2 does not exist in history form
</pre>

<p> Oops. Line 14 doesn't have a position 2, it only has positions 0 and 1.
(Like most programming languages, Lisp, and hence BioLisp, start counting
from 0).  Let's try again:

<pre>
<17>> (defprotocol stimulated-genes 
          (((table "biol:data;hiharadat.tbl") :line 14 :position 1) 
           ((datapoint 0) :line 15 :value 0)))
        (steps 14 15 16 17)
:: ; While compiling STIMULATED-GENES:
Warning: Free reference to undeclared variable *QUERY-GENES* assumed
         special.

STIMULATED-GENES
</pre>

<p> We still get a warning, but that's OK.  It's telling us we never
declared *QUERY-GENES* as a global variable, and that's true, we
didn't.  But some warnings can sometimes be ignored, and this is one
of them -- the program will work just fine.

<p> But what does all the complicated stuff after 'stimulate-genes'
in the DEFPROTOCOL definition mean?  

<p> We're declaring that the function STIMULATED-GENES will take two
keyword parameters (recall that all defprotocol parameters are
keywords) called TABLE and DATAPOINT.  The first parameter, TABLE
is to be given a default value of "biol:data;hiharadat.tbl" if no
value is provided when it is called.  The second parameter, DATAPOINT,
likewise has a default value of 0.

<p> So we see that if you want to give a parameter a default value,
put the name of the parameter and its default value into a list.  If
not, as with our first example, we can just use the name of the
parameter followed by the substitution instructions.  

<p> The ':line 14' means substitute in 'TABLE' on line 14, and the
':position 1' means substitute in 'TABLE' for whatever happens to
be in position 1 on line 14 (recall again we start with position 0).

<p> We can therefore restrict our substitutions to a particular line,
and we further restrict a subsititution to a particular position.

<p> Now with respect to DATAPOINT, we have ':line 15 :value 0', which
means do the substitution on line 15, and substitute 'DATAPOINT' for
every occurrence of 0 in the instruction, just as was done in the
first DEFPROTOCOL example.  There's only one occurrence as it happens,
and that is the index argument to AREF.  So instead of getting the 0th
value from our array, we've generalized things to get the
'DATAPOINT'-th value from the array.

<p> Theoretically at least, we now have a function, STIMULATED-GENES,
which can read any microarray table file we give it, and store into
the variable *QUERY-GENES* the list of genes which are stimulated by
more than 2.0 as their Nth data point, and return the number of genes
so stimulated.  Let's try it:

<pre>
<18>> (stimulated-genes :datapoint 1)
:: 144
<19>> *query-genes*
:: -- Another long list of genes --
</pre>

<p>  It looks like it worked.  Since we didn't give it a microarray file
as an argument, it defaulted to the hihara data file.  But this time it
compared against data point 1, rather than data point 0, and we see that
144, compared to 127, genes were stimulated sufficiently when the 2nd
data point value was used vs. the 1st.

<p> This second example is a bit more complicated in terms of what it
does with substitutions, and gives you a good flavor of what can be
done.  To really understand the capabilities, syntax and semantics of
the substitutions you will need to look at the formal specification,
which you can get from one of the people who runs this site.

<p> It's all well and good to be able to define a DEFPROTOCOL function
to generalize what you've been doing, but it's probably not terribly
useful unless you can store it away and load it back up another
session and/or another day.  And sure enough, BioLingua allows you to
do this using the SAVE-PROTOCOLS and LOAD-PROTOCOLS commands.

<pre>
<20>> (save-protocols 'stimulated-genes)
:: "/home/visitors/massar/protocols.lisp"
</pre>

<p>
By default, SAVE-PROTOCOLS will save a protocol (or a list of protocols)
to a file in your BioLingua workspace directory called 'protocols.lisp'.
In this case, user MASSAR's workspace directory is /home/visitors/massar/.

<p> Now if we were to come back days later and login again, we can
load our protocols file, and have all our protocols recreated:

<pre>
<1>> (fboundp 'stimulated-genes)
:: NIL
<2>> (load-protocols)
:: ;;; Compiling file /home/visitors/massar/protocols.lisp
; While compiling STIMULATED-GENES:
Warning: Free reference to undeclared variable *QUERY-GENES* assumed special.
Warning: Free reference to undeclared variable *QUERY-GENES* assumed special.
         /home/visitors/massar/protocols.lisp.
;;; Writing fasl file /home/visitors/massar/protocols.fasl
;;; Fasl write complete
; Fast loading /home/visitors/massar/protocols.fasl

"/home/visitors/massar/protocols.lisp"
<3>> (fboundp 'stimulated-genes)
:: #&lt;Function STIMULATED-GENES&gt;
</pre>

<p> First we see that the function STIMULATED-GENES is not defined
(remember, this is a different session than  before).  Then we load
the protocols we've saved, and we see that it now <i>is</i> defined,
and we can indeed use it:

<pre>
<4>> (stimulated-genes :datapoint 2)
:: 137
</pre>

<p> Note that before the protocols file was loaded, BioLingua compiled
the file, so it would run as fast as possible.  We see that we got a
similar warning to the warning we got before, about *QUERY-GENES*,
and, again, we can ignore it.  Our next session, if we haven't changed
the file by saving more protocols to it, it will already be compiled
and we won't see the warning as it loads.

<p> You can save a protocol to a file of your own choosing by providing
a filename, like so:

<pre>
(save-protocols 'my-protocol "my-protocol-file.lisp")
</pre>

<p>and then

<pre>
(load-protocols "my-protocol-file.lisp")
</pre>
