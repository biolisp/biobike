Dear Friend of the project formerly called BioLingua,

<p>

As a result of the following notice we have stopped using the name
"BioLingua", and have changed to "BioBike". You may scroll to the

Dear Dr. Shrager,

SUBJECT: Request (community petition) for halting misuse of the name and
mark "BioLingua"

It has recently come to our attention that you have started to use
the phrase BioLingua in the capacity of trademark and/or a name
characterizing your activities in the field of bioinformatics and
computational biology. We believe that this use infringes on
ownership rights of BioLingua trade name as well as BioLingua trademark
and BioLingua service mark.

We confirm that BioLingua Research Inc., has been using the phrase
BioLingua in the capacity of a trademark and a service mark for at least
12 years. In addition, the founder of BioLingua Research Inc. -Andreas K
Konopka- has been providing bioinformatics services under the trade name
BioLingua for at least two additional years before BioLingua Research
Inc. has been incorporated in the state of Maryland on April 25, 1994.
For your information, BioLingua Research Inc. is an established 501-c(3)
nonprofit corporation dedicated to computational biology and
bioinformatics; exactly the field to which your software
environment/initiative claims to pertain as well. The name of the
corporation -BioLingua Research Inc.- appears on all their publications,
software tools and databases since at least 1993 onwards. Moreover, the
term/mark BioLinguaSM is associated with research activities and
bioinformatics services of A. K. Konopka, D.A.M. Konings, L.F.
Fleischman, B. Felts, C. Hand, K. Murakami-Middleford among other
co-workers since at least the end of 1992.

After 1994 the term/mark BioLingua has been used as an abbreviation of
the full name -BioLingua Research Inc.- as well as a descriptor and mark
characterizing this group's diverse activities. Examples of such uses
are: BioLinguaSM Sequence Research Tools, publications of BioLingua,
BioLingua educational initiative, BioLingua software, BioLingua
tutorials, and so on. The research philosophy of integrating
computational biology with biology proper is well known to the community
of computational biologists since at least 1992 as a paradigm advocated
by BioLingua Research inc., while the specific research agenda,
editorial activities, and educational materials appear to be univocally
associated with the core name BioLingua used in the capacity of a trade
name and a service mark.

For these reasons, we, a group of undersigned independent members of
the bioinformatics/computational biology reasearch community, call
on you to discontinue using the trademark and trade name (BioLingua) for
your purposes, since continued use undermines BioLingua Research
Inc.'s work over many years as well as their commercial and
noncommercial future. This in turn would not benefit anyone because
BioLingua Research Inc. have clearly been the first to use the mark
"BioLingua" within the life sciences and computational biology community
and they have continued such usage for many years before you have begun
your attempts to characterize yourself with the same mark but without
BioLingua Research Inc.'s (known to our scientific community as
BioLingua) knowledge, consent, or permission.

In addition, your recent use of the name 'BioLingua' as described in
your papers in the journals Bioinformatics and The Scientist contradicts
BioLingua Research Inc's (i.e. BioLingua's) research vision stated and
re-stated for many years in multiple published articles and educational
materials. Therefore we have no doubts that your attempts to
characterize yourself with the mark 'BioLingua' are damaging the
reputation of BioLingua Research Inc. in the community of life
scientists, computational biologists, and bioinformaticians.

We, the undersigned, therefore request that you discontinue any further
use of the BioLingua mark. Please reply with an acknowledgment of
BioLingua Research Inc's ownership right to the mark and name BioLingua
as well as with a proposal of a timetable for halting your continued use
of this mark (and name). Thank you in advance for your prompt
consideration of our suggestions.

Sincerely,
