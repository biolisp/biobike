<center>BioLingua Student Projects</center>

<p>

Being a series of projects related to BioLingua that a student who
already knew Lisp could undertake in about the time of summer vacation
(~2 months).   If you are interested in working on any of these, please write to <a href=mailto:biolinguasupport@lists.stanford.edu>biolinguasupport@lists.stanford.edu</a>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Improve error handling and reporting so that non-Lispers
(esp. biologists) have some chance of figuring out what's wrong.  At
least provide a cleaner format for reporting stack traces (from the
(explain) function), and possibly do context-sensitive error analysis
(for example, showing the actual code that caused the problem).

<li>
Automatic organism loading from NCBI/XML format directly to the
BioLingua workspace (or to workspace fast load format).

<li>
"CVS frames" -- Track when frame contents change, like CVS.

<li>
"BioHyperCard" -- like ASP modules: User defines a module with embedded HTML/BioLisp
combined.  When the module is loaded, a set of dynamics server pages are
cons'ed.

<li>
Smooth out and clean the external code interface (for linux command line
programs); provide a way to generally specify the interface to complex
external programs (e.g., primer3).

<li>Re-up'ed GO (load latest GO from MySQL form, and rethread).

<li>UniProt threading.

<li>BioCyc auto-organism pathway model interface: Automatically create
an interface to Path-O-Logic to create pathway models and thread them
from the genomic data given by the person curating the organism.

<li>General way of running lisp or java-based applets from BioLingua
server (several people?)

<li>Interface to Marco Antoniotti's microarray analysis code.

<li>Interface to SMD.

<li>Upload and thread Sheldon Ball's Anvita
(http://international-lisp-conference.org/speakers.html#sheldon_ball)
knowledge base.

<li>Create a CACHE-like interface for gene annotation (several people?)

<li>Build a legal domain version of the KnowOS (several people?)

<li>Interface TRBL into TAIR.

<li>Javascript quasi-emacs for code editing.

<li>HTTPS

<li>Interface Aneil Mallavarapu's 'b' langauge (and/or other QP systems).

<li>Record/Interface Hybrow (www.hybrow.org).

<li>Interact w/Waldinger on the Gemini/Snark NL interface.

<li>NL via Lieberman's NLP methodology.
<ul>
