<p>

The BioBike web service is called a "Listener" because it listens to
your commands, executes them, and reports the results.  This is the
BioBike "programming environment" (hereafter, the BPE).  In previous
sections we learned how to write small programs in the BPE (using
DEFUN), but we didn't really go into much detail on how to debug
programs when you have problems, or on how to develop larger programs.
Together these are called the "program development process."

<p> 

Each programming environment requires a different style of program
development, so although some Lisp texts and tutorials explain some
common ways in which program development could or should take place,
these usually have to be understood in the context of each new
programming environment.  Program development in the BPE is very
different than most other commonplace programming environments,
primarily because there are specific limitations to what can go on
between the server and your web browser.  Understanding the structure
of the interaction between your web browser and the BioBike server
will help you to understand what you can and can't do, and will help
you understand how program development should go on in the BPE.

<p>

The topics considered here are:

<ul>
<li> Debugging using the Listener 
<li> A few simple tools to ease your typing
<li> Using the editor
</ul>
</font>

<p>

<big><b>Debugging in the BPE</b></big>

<p>

Because interaction between you and the BioBike server is so
limited, you have to be somewhat creative in your debugging
techniques for BioBike programs.

<p>

Errors: 

<p>

Errors are trapped normally by BioBike, and you get a normal error
report, but instead of ending up in a debugger, you are thrown back to
the BioBike Listener.  Any output that your program has done to that
point will be displayed, and you'll see the error, but the program
stops running at that point, and its state is lost.

<p>

Here's an example:

<p><pre>
(defun wrong! (n)
  (format t "It's really wrong to try to divide ~a by zero!~%" n)
  (/ n 0))

  >> (wrong! 4)
  :: It's really wrong to try to divide 4 by zero!
  Attempt to divide 4 by zero.
</pre><p>

Sometimes it's useful to force the program to stop when some condition
is encountered that you're trying to debug.  Normally, in Lisp, you
can use the BREAK function to essentially pause the program by
dropping into the interactive debugger.  Since there's no interactive
debugger in the BPE, you can't use BREAK.  (If you do, you'll get a
nice error message telling you as much.) However, you can use ERROR
instead.

<p>

For example:

<pre>
(defun right! (n m)
  (cond ((zerop m) (error "It's really wrong to try to divide ~a by ~a!~%" n m))
        (t (/ n m))))

  >> (right! 1.0 2.0)
  :: 0.5
  >> (right! 4.0 0.0)
  :: It's really wrong to try to divide 4.0 by 0.0!
</pre>

Here instead of you waiting for Lisp to find the error, we signaled
and error ourselves.

<p>

This is fine until an problem occurs in a place you didn't expect it to,
which is, of course, most of the time.  To aide in determining where such
an error occurred, the function EXPLAIN exists.  Calling EXPLAIN:

<pre>
>> (explain)
</pre>
immediately after an error occurs will cause a string showing the 'stack trace'
of the Lisp system at the point your error occurred.  While the output
is a bit hard to read without some getting used to, it can invaluable.
<p>

Print Tracing:
<p>
Since when an error occurs, you get all your output up to that point
(as we saw above) you can easily use what is perhaps the most
important, most common, and easiest debugging tool: Displaying values
along the way.  Here's an example:
<pre>
(defun self-traced (n m)
  (format t "N is ~a, and M is ~a~%" n m)
  (/ n m))

  >> (self-traced 3.0 4.0)
  :: N is 3.0, and M is 4.0
  0.75
  >> (self-traced 3.0 0.0)
  :: N is 3.0, and M is 0.0
  Attempt to divide 3.0 by zero.
</pre><p>

This is esp. useful when it's a little hard to figure out where the
error message is coming from.  For example:
<pre>
(defun ugly! ()
   (/ 5 (* 4 (- 3 (+ 1 2)))))

  >> (ugly!)
  :: Attempt to divide 5 by zero.
</pre>
Okay, but where along the line did the zero come from?? (I know that
it's obvious, but this is just an exercise!) 
<p>
One of the great things about Lisp is that you can wrap (print ...)
around any expression, and it outputs the value of the expression, and
then gives you the result anyway.  Watch:
<pre>
  >> (print 5)
  :: 5
  5
</pre>
We got 5 twice!  Once it was printed, and once it was returned from
print.  So, we can rewrite Ugly! as:
<pre>
(defun ugly! ()
   (/ 5 (print (* 4 (print (- 3 (print (+ 1 2))))))))

  >> (ugly!)
  :: 
  3 
  0 
  0 
  Attempt to divide 5 by zero.
  :: Attempt to divide 5 by zero.
</pre>
Aha!  So (+ 1 2) gave us 3, which, when subtracted from 3 gave us 0;
There's the culprit!  (Notice that the prints happen 'inside out', not
'left to right', an important bit of Lisp knowledge to have).
<p>
Here's another great thing about Lisp:
<pre>
(defmacro !! (expr)
  `(third (print (list ',expr '=> ,expr))))

(defun ugly! ()
   (/ 5 (!! (* 4 (!! (- 3 (!! (+ 1 2))))))))

  >> (ugly!)
  :: 
  ((+ 1 2) => 3) 
  ((- 3 (!! (+ 1 2))) => 0) 
  ((* 4 (!! (- 3 (!! #)))) => 0) 
  Attempt to divide 5 by zero.
</pre>
The !! macro displays both the expression and it's result, and then
passes the result to the next expression!  If that's not way cool,
then nothing is!  (The '#' in the last !! output is a subexpression
that is nested so deeply that instead of printing it out, which would
take up too much space, the printer decided to just put '#' to show
you that there's something there.  This can be adjusted using Common
Lisp global variable *PRINT-LEVEL*, but since we know what's there
anyway, this isn't a big deal to us now.)

<p>
Call tracing:
<p>

You can tell Lisp to show you when it enters a function, the arguments
to that function, when it leaves a function, and the value that
function returns.  You do this by using TRACE.  Here's an example.

<pre>
(defun fred (x) (1+ x))
(defun wilma (y) (1- (fred y)))
(trace fred wilma)

(fred 3)

0[9]: (WILMA 3)
   1[9]: (FRED 3)
   1[9]: returned 4
 0[9]: returned 3
 0[9]: (FRED 3)
 0[9]: returned 4

</pre>

The first thing that happens is that WILMA gets called with 3 as its argument.
Inside of WILMA (denoted by the indentation), FRED gets called, also with 3
as its argument.  FRED returns 4, then WILMA returns 1- that, or 3 (again,
denoted by the indentaton).  Finally, our outermost call to FRED can happen
since we now know that value to pass it (again 3), and FRED returns 4.
<p>
The Listener will allow you to trace functions that you've defined for 
yourself, but it will not allow you to trace functions that BioBike has
defined for you, or standard Lisp functions.  This is because everyone is
using those same functions, and if you traced, say, LOAD-ORGANISM, then
every time anyone called LOAD-ORGANISM the trace printout would appear!
<p>
You can untrace using, strangely, enough, the UNTRACE function.
You can untrace every function you are currently tracing by calling 
UNTRACE with no arguments.
<pre>
(untrace)
</pre>

<p>
<big><b>A few simple tools</b></big>
<p>

Recall above we typed
<pre>
(defun ugly! ()
   (/ 5 (!! (* 4 (!! (- 3 (!! (+ 1 2))))))))
</pre>
This can more easily be entered using the BPE's 'end bracket'
convention:
<pre>
(defun ugly! ()
   (/ 5 (!! (* 4 (!! (- 3 (!! (+ 1 2]
</pre>
If a right bracket character is the last character you enter, then the
BPE will 'expand' it with right parentheses until all unmatched left 
parenthesesis have been matched.
<p>
Now suppose that yesterday you typed
<pre>
(defun frobnicate-and-computate (x y)
  (exp (+ (* x x) (* y y) 0.25))
</pre>
into the BPE.  Its now today, and you realize you didn't save your function
anywhere, and you either don't quite remember its definition or don't feel
like typing it all again.  No problem.  If you type:
<pre>
(defun fr
</pre>
into the BPE in the one-line entry box and hit ENTER, the entire definition
above will appear in the multi-line entry box!
<p>
What's going on is that the BPE saves everything you enter for posterity,
and when you call upon posterity by typing in an incomplete form, it does
a match of what you typed against the initial characters of your saved
entries.  (This is otherwise known as history completion).
<p>
Now suppose that yesterday, after you defined frobinate-and-computate,
you then typed in
<pre>
(defun frobnicate-and-obfuscate (x y)
  (format t "There's no answer because it's obfuscated")) 
</pre> 
Again pretend it's today and you type 
<pre> 
(defun fr
</pre>
In the one-line entry box.  Now the definition of
frobnicate-and-obfuscate will appear in the multi-line entry box
because it matches and is chronologically more recent.  How to get
what you really want, the definition of frobnicate-and-computate?
Very simple!  Notice that nothing has changed in the one-line entry box.
Simply do an ENTER again (making sure the focus is in the one-line box).
Voila!  The definition of frobnicate-and-obfuscate will disappear from
the multiline entry box and the definition of frobnicate-and-computate
will take its place.
<p>
You can 'scroll back' in history as far as you want.  If you reach a point
where there are no further matches, the history completion mechanism
simply 'rolls' itself over and starts again from the most chronologically
recent match.

<p>
<big><b>Using the Editor</b></big>
<p>

To write very simple functions, you can use the Multiline box of the
Listener.  But if you need to write something more than a few lines
long, and you are interested in easily saving it, you should consider
using the Listener's simple editing facility. 

<p>
<font color = "red">
Note: **** Some of the facilities described below require using a
Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox flavored browser, not an Internet Explorer
browser ****
</font>

<p>

To use it, from the Listener click on the <big><font
color="green">Browse BioFiles</font></big> link at the bottom of the
page. On that page, the first text line after the long, thin,
horizontal grey line should be a link to your home directory,
something like

<pre>
/home/visitors/fred/
</pre>

(especially if your login name is fred...)
<p>
Click on this link.  You should see a list of subdirectories (if you
have any) and a list of files you have in your BioBike home
directory.  If you want to edit an existing file you can click on the
<font color="green">edit</font> link to the left of the file name.  If
you want to create a new file (or make a subdirectory), click on the
link that says 'New file or subdirectory' just above the long, thin,
horizontal grey line.  Go ahead and do that.  Enter the name of the
file -- let's call it hyp.lisp.  then hit ENTER.  Shazam!  You now 
have a Weblistener editor page.
<p>
Starting typing:
<pre>
(in-package :fred)  ;; or whatever your login name is
</pre>

Notice that like the Weblistener itself, when you type a close paren,
it shows you the matching open paren (in the little box near the top
right labelled 'Info:').
<p>
Now let's start typing in your function definition:
<pre>
(defun hypotenuse (side1 side2)
</pre>
Notice that when you type the space after 'defun' the 'Info:' display
box shows you the argument names and syntax for this primitive.
<p>
Note also that when you hit ENTER, after it goes to the next line it
automatically indents.  (It's a simple editor -- the indentation isn't
perfect, and doesn't always conform to standard Lisp indentation
standards, but it is useful nonetheless).
<p>
Let's continue typing:
<pre>
  (sqrt (+ (* side1 side1) (* side2 side2))))
</pre>
Okay, we're done with our function definition.
Does it work?
<p>
Click on the 'Save-Compile-Load' button just above the big editor box.
This brings you back to the Weblistener and, as you can see, has
automatically executed the Lisp form

<pre>
(load (compile-file "/home/visitors/fred/hyp.lisp"))
</pre>
for you, which compiles your file (hyp.lisp), creating a binary file
(hyp.fasl), and load that file so that you can execute your function.
By the way, as the button's name implies, it has also saved your code
to disk.
<p>
Now if you type into the single-line box:
<pre>
(hypotenuse 3 4)
5.0
</pre>
If you want to get back to your editor window you can use the 'back'
arrow button on your browser repeatedly and you will eventually get there.
<p>
The 'Reindent' button (which is also present below the Multiline box in the
standard Weblistener) reindents your code according to a few simple
heuristics.  This can be very useful, but it can also be deceptive in that
it does not understand some of the more obscure indenting conventions that
a standard Lisp-knowledgeable editor such as Emacs uses.      
<p>
If you reindent your code and it has too few or too many parentheses,
the indenter will insert a comment to this effect into the editor box.
This comment will automagically go away the next time you reindent if
you have managed to correct your paren-balancing problem.
