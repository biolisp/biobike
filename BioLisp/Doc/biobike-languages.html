Introduction.
</center> </h2>

The BioBike system can be programmed using two similar but
distinct programming languages.  The first, referred to as
<font color="green"> <b> BioLisp </b> </font>,
is Common Lisp with many additional functions useful to biologists.  
The second, referred to as 
<font color="green"> <b> BBL </b> </font> </i>, 
is a dialect of Lisp with 
somewhat different syntax and semantics.  It is designed to be more easily learned
by biologists than the Common Lisp language, which is complex and
was designed for professional programmers.  As with BioLisp, BBL
includes a rich set of functions useful to biologists.  

<p>
When you log in, you will either be in BioLisp mode or BBL mode; the system
will tell you what mode you are in.  The command
<p>
<code> (lisp) </code>
<p>
will put you into BioLisp mode if you are in BBL mode, while the command
<p>
<code> (bbl) </code>
<p>
will put you into BBL mode if you are in BioLisp mode.  The function
<p>
<p>
<code> (user-mode) </code>
<p> 
will tell you which mode you are in.

Getting Started with BioLisp.
</center> </h2>

The BioLisp language can be learned by going back to the BioBike system
main documentation page and examining the following sections:
<p>

<ul>
<li> Introductory Materials and Tutorial Examples --  A large number of 
introductory lessons to Lisp, the BioBike system and biological programming
are provided.

<li> Live Tutorials -- Another rich set of tutorials wherein the user
can interact with BioBike by executing various code snippets and programs. 

<li> Common Lisp -- Provides links for those interested
in learning in-depth the Common Lisp language.  

</ul>

Getting Started with BBL.
</center> </h2>

The BBL language is still under development.  It can be learned by
going to the <a href="http://ramsites.net/~biobike/help/index.html">
Main BBL page.  </a>  You may try some tutorials for BBL by
entering BBL mode (see above) from the main Weblistener page, 
and selecting from the Help... menu at the bottom of that page the
<i>Live Tutorials</i> option.
There is also a <a href="bbl-description.html"> Technical Overview</a>.
The BBL language was conceived by
<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~elhaij/"> Jeff Elhai </a>.
