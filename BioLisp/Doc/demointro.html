Click <a target=_blank href=http://bioinformatics.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bth465?ijkey=56vHZ9Co9fWyA&keytype=ref>here for a preprint (in PDF) of the BioBike paper</a>, appearing in BioInformatics (Oxford U. Press).

When you click above you will be given free access to the BioBike
demo server.  You will have to make up a username (any name you like)
and (optionally) give your email address.

<p>
You may wish to use <a target=_blank href=tour.html>this Tour of BioBike</a> to get started.
<p>
Although this is a fully operational BioBike cyanobacterial server, please note that:
<ul>
<p>
<li>

Because of changes and upgrades to BioBike since the appearance of
<a target=_blank href=http://bioinformatics.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bth465?ijkey=56vHZ9Co9fWyA&keytype=ref>our paper</a>, some of the examples work slightly differently in
the online server than they appeared in the paper.  <a
href="#examples">See the notes below for the latest updates to those
examples.</a>

<p>
<li>The duration of computations that can be executed on the demo
server is limited to 40 seconds per computation.  (Although your time
online is not limited.)
<p>
<li>The demo server should not be used for commerical work; we do not
guarantee the validity of the data, nor the stability of the server. (See
legalese below.)
<p>

<li>The information that you leave on the server (e.g., your account,
and any results that you create) may be erased without notice; <font
color=red>You are responsible for backing up your own work.</font>

<p>
<li><h3><font color=Green>All interactions with the server are
recorded and may be perused by the developers and system
administrators.</h3></font>
<p>

<li>

This service is not to be used for any purpose other than brief
exploration of the BioBike system, or in conjunction with specific
student projects and homework.  Any other use, as determined at the
sole discretion of the operators of the site, will lead to immediate
shutdown of the service.

<h3>Updates to the examples given in <a target=_blank href=http://bioinformatics.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bth465?ijkey=56vHZ9Co9fWyA&keytype=ref>Massar, et al. (2005)</a>:</h3>

<u>Example #1 (Figure 2)</u> should work as in the paper.

<p><p>

<u>Example #2 (Figure 3)</u> requires a small change: Everywhere where a
BioCyc frame is mentioned, you need to insert "oc." before the frames
name.  For example, instead of: ...(#^reaction-list pathway)... it should read: 
(#^oc.reaction-list pathway).  With these changes, the new example reads:

<pre>
>> (defun instantiate-pathway (pathway)
     (loop for reaction in (ensure-list (#^oc.reaction-list pathway))
           as enzymes = (loop for ez-reaction in
                              (ensure-list (#^oc.enzymatic-reaction reaction))
                              collect (#^oc.enzyme ez-reaction))
           append (loop for enzyme in enzymes
                        collect (#^oc.gene enzyme))))

>> (instantiate-pathway #$oc.Phoslipsyn-Pwy)
:: (#$S6803.slr1369 #$S6803.sll1522 #$S6803.slr0054)

>> (loop for pathway in (#^allsubclasses #$oc.pathways)
         collect (list pathway
         (instantiate-pathway pathway)))
</pre>

<p><p>
<u>Example #3 (Figure 4)</u> will not align all the sequences if run as described in the paper. To give the published results, change the first command:

<pre>
(ASSIGN cph-annotated (GENES-DESCRIBED-BY "cyanophycin synth"))
</pre>to:



<pre>
(ASSIGN cph-annotated (GENES-DESCRIBED-BY "cyanophycin synth" MAKE-ONE-LIST T))</pre>
.
