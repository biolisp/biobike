             INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE BIOLISP TUTORIALS


************  WARNING, WARNING:  THIS STUFF IS TOTALLY OBSOLETE.
************  THE TUTORIALS EXIST, BUT THE LOADER PROBABLY WON'T LOAD THEM!
************  AND THE EXAMPLES IN THE TUTORIALS MAY OR MAY NOT WORK.


1.  INSTALLING THE SYSTEM

You've probably already downloaded the installation and unzipped it.
If not, you can use a web browser to download the installation file
from

<here>

and then you can unzip the downloaded file (using unzip or gunzip on
Unix, Winzip or some other similar tool on Windows).

You can unzip the files into any directory you wish.  For the rest of
this README we will use

C:/Lispcode/biolisp/

as the place we have put the unzipped files.  This means we told our
unzip program to unzip the files to C:/Lispcode/, and the unzipping
program created the biolisp subdirectory for us (because that was the
toplevel directory name specified when we created the installation zip
file).  You should substitute the path of the directory you chose to
unzip the files into for the above path whenever the examples use
the above path.

Once you've unzipped the files successfully, you need to start up a
Lisp.  The tutorials are known to work in the following configurations:

  WINDOWS
    ALLEGRO (<Franz>
    LISPWORKS (<Xanalys>)

  UNIX
    ALLEGRO
    LISPWORKS

  MACINTOSH
    MCL (not tested)

Once your Lisp is started up, you should see a prompt (although Corman
Lisp has no prompt when using its IDE).  We'll assume the prompt looks
like

 >

Now to the right of the prompt type (don't type the '>' !)

 > (load "C:/Lispcode/biolisp/bioload.lisp")

and hit ENTER

(using Corman Lisp and its IDE you type the above (no '>' !)
and hold down SHIFT and hit ENTER).

This should compile most of the files composing the BioLisp Tutorial
and load them into your Lisp.

If the Lisp does not complete the process it will print out some sort
of error message.  You will either need to figure out what went wrong
and fix it (and hopefully inform us via email!), or send email to

<mailing list>

with a transcript of what you typed and what output you got, and we will
try to help you figure out what the problem is.

Assuming the compilation and loading process terminated successfully
you should see some output generated by the compile/load process
followed by the last line of output and the prompt, e.g.

...

2.  GOING THROUGH THE TUTORIALS

You can access the tutorial web pages

<here>

You can simply follow the tutorial instructions (which include a FAQ
on how to deal with Lisp).  You will cut and paste various expressions
from the tutorial into your Lisp window, and Lisp will execute them.

Another approach is to also look at the source code file that is provided
for each tutorial as you are going through it.  This will give you
more of an opportunity to see how Lisp code is written and structured.

Many of the functions shown in the tutorial text are defined in the
source code files.  Some additional functions are also defined to make
it easy for you to multiple tutorial steps at once.  Some function
definitions are commented out; this is usually because more than one
definition of the same function is used in the tutorials, often a
basic definition and then an improved version.  The earlier definitions
given in the tutorial are always the ones commented out.  Therefore
make sure you cut and paste the earlier definitions into Lisp as you
encounter them in the tutorial text.


3.  WHAT NEXT?

After you've made your way through all the tutorials you can
