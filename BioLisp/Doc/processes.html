<pre>
There's now code  to do timeouts and
to kill processes.

Here's how it works:

The variable *execution-timelimit* is set to 600 seconds.
Any form you enter from the Bioweblistener that takes more
than that will result in something like the following:



;; <<< *** TIMEOUT TIMEOUT TIMEOUT *** >>>
;; <<< *** COMPUTATION ABORTED ***>>>
;; <<< *** ADJUST *EXECUTION-TIMELIMIT* TO RUN LONGER ***
>>>
;; <<< *** CURRENT VALUE IS 5 SECONDS ***>>>

NIL

-----------------------------------------

You can SETQ the value of *EXECUTION-TIMELIMIT* to be
whatever you like, but if the value is larger than 600
seconds the Bioweblistener will make your form execute
at low priority compared to other forms.


The following functions deal with killing processes:

ALL-MY-PROCESSES
ALL-WEBUSER-PROCESSES
KILL-MY-PROCESS
KILL-MY-PROCESSES

ALL-MY_PROCESSES lists all your currently running webuser processes
in a table.  (You should only have one unless you have
multiple browser windows open). System processes and other
processes are not listed.

Each process is identified by a PID, a small integer.

You can use this PID as the argument to KILL-MY-PROCESS.

(KILL-MY-PROCESSES and KILL-MY-PROCESS are equivalent, each
accepts any number of processes to kill)

ALL-WEBUSER-PROCESSES lists not only your but all users'
running webuser processes.

There is a secret way to enable KILL-MY-PROCESS so that you
can use it to kill anyone's process, not just your own.
But if I told you what it was it would no longer be secret,
except I'd have to kill you, at which point it would be 
secret again.  Quite the conundrum.

Anyway, THERE IS ONE HUGE, GARGANTUAN, MASSIVE GOTCHA with
killing processes:

IF YOU KILL A PROCESS, IT WILL START RIGHT BACK UP AGAIN !!!!

Yup, you can't just kill it, you have to drive a stake through
it's heart.

The only way to really kill a process dead is to first kill the
browser window from which you are running the process, and
then issue the KILL-MY-PROCESS command.

So, let's say you suddenly realize the expression you typed
into the Bioweblistener causes an infinite loop or is going
to execute for far longer than you initially thought.  Here's
what you do:

Step 1:  In another browser or another browser window, connect
again to the BioWebListener and log in again.

Step 2:  In this new Bioweblistener session, execute

(all-my-processes)

You should see two processes listed.  The one with the lower PID
number is the one you want to kill (the one with the higher one
is the one executing the all-my-processes command, the one you
are 'in')

Step 3:  Close the original browser or browser window.

Step 4:  Go back to the new browser window.

Step 5:  Issue the command

(kill-my-process <pid>)

where <pid> is the integer process-id listed by the all-my-processes
command as discussed above.

Step 6:  Issue the command

(all-my-processes)

There should only be one now listed.  The one with the PID
you killed should be gone.
