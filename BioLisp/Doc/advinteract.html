<p>

By the time you've arrived here you should be an expert at using
BioBike, and BioLisp. The purpose of this section is to explain some
of the advanced features of BioBike and the BioBike listener that will
make your life a little more pleasant -- well, okay, maybe your life
will be the same unpleasant mess it's always been, we really can't
help you with that, but maybe you'll enjoy your time with BioBike a
little more.

<p>
<h3>Multiple session and session side effects</h3>

<p>

So far you've been entering functions into the Eval box and short
expressions into the Enter box. That's all well and good, but you've
probably wondered whether there is a way to save your work so that you
don't have to do this all over again when you next log in.

<p>

First off, your work is saved between sessions so long as (a) the
BioBike server hasn't been rebooted, and (b) you log into the same
session as you left. We rarely reboot the server, so for the moment,
let's skip that problem. How do you log into the same session? Up to
this point every time you've logged in you've pressed the "New Login",
but there's that other "Previous Session" button. What that does is to
let you choose from among previous sessions that you might have left
but would like to return to. Each time you press "New Login" a new
session is created for you, whereas if you press "Previous Session"
you are given a choice to reconnect to one that you left. You might
have already accidentally discovered this because if you enter your
userid and password and just press ENTER instead of either "New Login"
or "Previous Session", it acts like you pressed Previous Session and
just goes to that list -- which probably totally confused you. If you
do do this by accident, there's a button at the bottom of the page
that says: "Start a New Session", which will just do the same things
as if you'd pressed "New Login" to begin with. But you can also chose
from among the myriad previous sessions that you left around and
didn't even know you were doing it! (All the things with # signs in
the "Previous Sessions" page.

<p>

If and when you DO pressed "Previous Session" (or just ENTER) upon
logging in, you'll notice that the previous sessions are listed in
reverse chronological order -- that is, the most recent one is at the
top, and so forth to the very first session that you left.  For fun,
if you've never done this before, go back and try to log in again, but
this time press "Previous Session" (or just ENTER) when you login, and
select one of your previous sessions (if you have any). When you do
you'll (probably) be <i>shocked</i> to see that *all* of your previous
work is still there in the history, just like you left it -- possibly
days or weeks ago! And you can just pick up right where you left off
-- mostly.

<p>

Mostly? Why "Mostly"??? Well, although each of your sessions has a
separate history, they <i>share global state</i>, which means that all
the variables and functions that you created for yourself are shared
by <i>all</i> of your sessions. So, for example, if you did: (setq a
5) in one session, and then logged in again (as a new session), A
would still have the value 5. This is the way BioBike is designed so
that you can log out and come back tomorrow and log back in and
continue more-or-less where you left off. Let's say that when you log
back in (to a new session, as just described), and then you do: (setq
a 6). Then you log out, and the next time, you log back into <i>the
first session</i> -- that is, the one where you had set A to 5. If you
now examine the value of A you'll be surprised to see that it's 6, not
5! That's because, as just described, all your sessions <i>share
global state</i>, which means that all the variables and functions
that you created for yourself are shared by <i>all</i> of your
sessions.

<p>

The technical term for this is "side effect" -- that is, all your
sessions <i>side effect one another</i>; they have side effects on one
another's global state (variables and functions).

<p>

This is true of function definitions as well: If you define a function
in one session, it's defined that way for all future different
sessions, as well as all past sessions -- that's because just like
variables, function definitions are global (to your username).

<p>

This is only really confusing if you try to go back and forth between
sessions, so if you never do that (either accidentally or on purpose),
you don't have to worry about this. Why, you might well ask, would you
ever go back and forth between sessions on purpose? There are a number
of reasons that you might want to do this. The main one is just to get
back to where you were. If you press "Previous Session" when you log
in, and choose the top numbered session -- your latest one -- you'll
be right back where you were, including your history and the contents
of your eval and enter boxes, and you can pick up right where you left
off!

<p>

Another use for being able to manage multiple sessions is that you
could have multiple BioBike listeners open at the same time, both
logged into the same global variable and function space (as described
above), but doing different things. For example, you could be
developing some new code through one of these, and testing or running
code through the other. <i>Be careful</i>, though, in this section
because if you change any of the functions in one session that are
being executed in the other, you'll <i>dynamically change the
behavior of the other session</i>. Under some very unusual
circumstances you might actually <i>want</i> this behavior, but those
circumstances are really really rare!

<p>

There are ways to create session-local global variables (but not
functions), but it's such a rare and advanced thing that it's
described in another document altogether!

<p>

<h3>Creating and editing loadable modules</h3>

Above we mentioned that you can retain your session history, and use
multiple sessions, as long as the BioBike server hasn't been
rebooted. When the server reboots, all left-over sessions are
lost. But then how are you supposed to carry your work forward? There
are several ways to do this. The classical way, and the one we're
going to discuss here, is to create code and data modules that you can
reload later, either when you have to (because maybe the server has
rebooted and everything you did is lost), or you want to (because
you've made a mess and want to get back to some sensible state!) In
either case, the way that you do this is to create text files in your
file space that has lisp code and data in them, and then simply reload
these when you need to or want to. Usually such files are designed to
"load clean", which means that they do all their own data setup, and
initialize everything (including and esp. all your global values) so
that it all works right whether you've come into a freshly started
BioBike server, or you've messed yourself up so badly that you want to
start over. Actually, more commonly than either of these cases, it's
often quite useful to do your editing in the file, and then reload it
for testing. This is esp. true if you have several small function that
interact with one another. Regardless of the reason you want to use
file-based modules, here's how you do it.

<p>

For you have to create the file. There are several ways to do
this. The simplest is to go to your filespace by using the "Browse
Files" link at the bottom of the listener page. This will bring up
something that look like this:

<pre>
  Biobike Viewable File Directories
---------------------------------------
 /home/BioDemo/
 <font color=green>/home/BioDemo/visitors/yourname/</font>
 /home/BioDemo/visitors/shared-files/
 /usr/local/bioetc/
 /home/BioDemo/visitors/
</pre>

The green one (the one with your name in it) is your file
directory. Click on that one to get to your directory, and you'll get
something like this:

<pre>
  Biobike Directory Listing
  Listing for /home/BioDemo/visitors/yourname/
  [New file or subdirectory]  [Delete directory files]
--------------------------------------------------------
up ..  
dir .cih 
dir .newcih 
dir session-logs 

[edit]  +cih+.lisp       05/02/05 12:16
[edit]  +cih-cache+.lisp 06/10/05 14:49    
</pre>

Notice the button called [New file or subdirectory]. When you click it
you'll get something like this:

<pre>
Create New File or Directory
Current Directory: /home/BioDemo/visitors/yourname/
(_) New File (_) New Subdirectory    Name: _____________________
</pre>

Click on New File (it's the default), and type in the name of your new
file. Call is "fax.lisp" for now -- don't include the quote marks!, so,
it's just: fax.lisp

<p>

And press ENTER.

<p>

When you do this you'll end up in the BioBike code editor, editing you
new file, which has, unsurprisingly, nothing in it! Let's put something
in it! Type in, or cut/paste in the following code:

<pre>
  (defun fact (n)
  (cond ((zerop n) 1)
  (t (* n (fact (1- n))))))

  (defun run! (m)
  (loop for i from 1 to m
  collect (fact m)))
</pre>

Now press the [Reindent] button. By magic, your code should get
reformatting to look something like:

<pre>
(defun fact (n)
  (cond ((zerop n) 1)
        (t (* n (fact (1- n))))))

(defun run! (m)
  (loop for i from 1 to m
        collect (fact m)))
</pre>

Now, press [Save-Compile-Load]...

<p>

Notice that you ended up back in the BioBike listener, and it
automatically evaluated:

<pre>
(load (compile-file "/home/BioDemo/visitors/yourname/fax.lisp"))
</pre>

That's all you have to do! Your code is saved forever, and you can try
it out right now:

<pre>
  >> (run! 5)       ; Remember NOT to put in the >>
  :: (120 120 120 120 120)
</pre>

<i>Voila!</i>... uh, well, almost voila... something's wrong. We were
expecting the factorials of all the numbers up to 5, not just 5 copies
of 5! ... Hmmm. Let's go back and look at our code: Press the "Prev"
link (in "Files: Prev All" at the bottom of the page -- note that this
is three different links! You want to click right on the word "Prev"!)

<p>

If you did that right you'll be back editing your file, fax.lisp! Do
you see the error? (Hint, the problem is in run!, where it calls
fact.) Fix it, then press [Save-Compile-Load] again and test your fix.

<p>

[For fun, and to see a neat Lisp trick, try: (run! 100)]

<p>

That's all you need to know in order to create your own lisp code
modules. Note that when you leave and come back, your modules are
still there, just as you left them, and you can either directly enter
the (load (compile-file ...)) command again to get the code back or,
more simply, just use "Browse Files" like we did before to get to your
directory, and then press the [Edit] button next to the file you want
to edit. (And if you've connected to the same session as before, the
"Prev" button will still work!)

<p>

Another way to get to your file, if it's already loaded, is to choose
"Other tools..." > "My Stuff". This will give you a list of all your
global functions and variables. It will look something like this:
<pre>
Your Variables:
   ...

Your Functions:

Name (Edit in Multibox)   Source File   Scratch File 
   ...
<font color=blue>     RUN!                 view  edit        edit </font>
   ...
</pre>

If you click the first "edit" button (the one under "Source File"),
you'll end up back editing your module.

<p>

There's some technique involved in putting together "proper" modules,
but that's beyond the scope of this section. That's also mostly beyond
the scope of the BioBike documentation, having to do with how to
declare certain types of variables, and how to order your functions in
your modules. These are the sort of things that you learn by observing
how people who know what they're doing do. In the meantime, here are a
few more interaction tricks.

<p>

<h3>Tips and tricks for convenient BioBike usage</h3>

The BioBike listener is a pretty complex thing to interact with. The
"standard" methods described above, and in the previous sections, are
sometimes cumbersome. This section presents a list of little tricks
that we've learned through experience with BioBike that you can make
you life with the listener a little nicer. These aren't in any
particular order, and none of these is a very strong suggestion. You
might give them a try and see if you like them, and let us know other
tips and tricks that you've developed.

<p>
<li><b>Using "Enter Completion" to get back old expressions</b>
<p>

Suppose you did something yesterday, or last week, that you want to
get back, but you don't remember it in detail; maybe it was a complex
definition, or a load command for a particular file that you don't
feel like typing in again. Enter completion can recover <i>any</i>
expression that you have evaluated, whether in the Enter or Eval box
at <i>any</i> time in the past (regardless of session of BioBike
server reboot!) 

<p>

To use "enter completion" simply type the beginning of the expression,
usually something like:
<pre>
  (defun 

or:

  (load 

</pre>

into the Enter box and click [Enter] (or press the enter key). Each
time you do click (or press) [Enter] you'll see the next most recent
possible completion will be put into the Eval box. Press/click enter
over and over to move backward through your history until you find the
thing you're looking for, and then do what you like with it!

<p>
<li><b>Keeping multiple expressions in the Eval box</b>
<p>

It turns out that even though only the first thing that you put in the
eval box gets evaluated, everything gets saved in the box, even into
future sessions (as described above where we talked about logging into
the same session again). This turns out to be a convenient way to
store a series of expressions that you want to do over again, possibly
in different orders, which is a little more convenient than having to
fish them out of your history list, or using "enter completion" (as above).

<p>

For example, suppose that for some weird reason you want to do these
five expressions over and over in various orders -- you're testing out
your understanding of Lisp math, or some such thing:

<pre>
  (+ 1 2)
  (* 3 4)
  (/ 5 6)
</pre>

If you put these three into the Eval box in this order, and then press
[Eval], only the first one (+ 1 2) will actually get evaluated, but
all three will still appear in the box! If you want to do a different
one, just move it to the top, leaving the rest in place, and then
<i>that one</i> will be evaluated, and so on.  The three expressions
will even stay together in the history list, so if you use "enter
completion" (as above) they'll <i>all</i> re-appear in the Eval box!

<p>
<li><b>Using multiple windows</b>
<p>

Many of the controls in the listener, such as "Browse Files", "Files:
Prev All", and "Browse Frames" default to working in the same web
browser as the listener, meaning that when you're done with whatever
you're doing, you have to get back to the listener (which is usually
not a big problem). But sometimes you want to leave those windows open
and still be able to control the listener. Some examples where you might want multiple windows:

<p>

<ul> 

<li>You might want to edit a module file (as described above) and test
it without having to go back and forth all the time: listener ->
editor -> listener -> editor over and over. 

<p>

<li>You're trying to write some complex code that runs around in
the knowledge base and you want to keep a frame browser open at the
same time as both the listener <i>and</i> maybe also the code editor.

<p>

<li>You are working on some code that creates an Excel-loadable file
in your directory that you download every time you make a change and
test out the function to see how it worked. Normally you'd have to go
between the listener, the editor, and several pages of file browser in
order to do this.

</ul>

<p>

In each of these cases, if you're a little clever and a little
careful, you can save yourself enormous amount of clicking and time by
opening the various pages <i>in new browsers</i> (usually by
right-clicking on the link, instead of left clicking it, and choosing
"open in new window").

<p>

For example, if you open the frame browser ("Browse Frames") in a new
window, you can browse frames to your heart's content and still work
in the listener; these windows are entirely independent! And if you
open the "Prev" button (as described above in the discussion of module
files) in a new window, you'll be able to edit and save your code in
that new window, and just leave it around while testing your code in
the listener.

<p>

Let's take that last case (both editing and testing code at the same
time) and see how you can do it. The only trick is how to get the code
back into the listener without closing your editor. (If you were to
press "[Save-Compile-Load]" not only would be editor close, but the
editor page would become another listener -- totally confusing!)

<p>

The way I do this is by just leaving the (load (compile ...)) command
in the Enter box in the listener, and then using [Save] instead of
[Save-Compile-Load]. This just saves the file, but doesn't close the
editor, but it also doesn't do the (load (compile ...)) thing, so you
have to do that in the listener to get your code loaded up for testing
in the listener. (The "enter completion" and/or "multiple
expressions" tricks described above are useful for this!)
