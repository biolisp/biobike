<h3> What's the deal with NIL and () ?  Sometimes one gets printed out,
sometimes the other.  Are they different? </h3>

They are identical.  NIL is not distinct from () in any sense in terms of
Lisp internals.  (Of course the string "NIL" is distinct from the string "()"
but that has nothing to do with Lisp internals).
<p>

Put another way, NIL and () are EQ.
<p>

In Lisp, as opposed to many other similar languages, the empty list,
(), and logical FALSE, NIL, are identical.  This turns out to be
extremely useful in many cases, and a pain in the ass in a few.
<p>
Usually  what gets printed out is NIL. Sometimes you see () because
it is possible to tell the Lisp printer to print out () instead of NIL.
Also, there may be code that does its own printing, and it might print
out a list by printing a left paren, then the elements, then a right
paren, without specifically checking whether the list is empty.

<a name="TAG-EQUALP-FRAMES"></a>
<h3>Why can't I ask whether a frame is EQUALP another frame?  When I
do: (equalp #$frame1 #$frame2) it blows up in spectacular fashion with
a stack overflow... And what's the deal with EQ, EQL, =, EQUAL, STRING=,
STRING-EQUAL, EQUALP, and probably other equality tests I know nothing
about, anyway?</h3>

<p>

This happens because you are using EQUALP as a test instead of EQ or
EQL.  EQUALP is defined recursively -- two things can be EQUALP if
they have components and their components are pairwise EQUALP, so you
may be able to see how you could get into an infinite recursion,
although not the particulars in this case.

<p>

Now a frame is an object that has components.  And one of its components
is its #$Fname, which itself is a frame, which has components, one of which
is its #$Fname, which itself is a frame, which has components, one of which
is its #$Fname,... stack overflow ... core dumped.

<p>

While it is tempting to use EQUALP as your general, all-purpose
comparison function, in some cases (as we just demonstrated) it's
going to get you into trouble.  You can't compare one frame to another
using EQUALP, but you can use EQUAL, EQ, or EQL.

<p>

Unfortunately, equality is not a trivial concept.  Sometimes you
really have to think about what it is you are asking about in terms of
similarity, equality, identicalness, etc.  One key thing to understand
is when things are unique and when they are not.

<p>

For example, there is exactly one, and only one, symbol denoted by:
CAR You can type 'CAR as many times as you want and you will always
get back the identical, same, unique symbol named CAR.  If you setf two
different variables to 'CAR, they are both pointing to exactly the
same thing, and you can use any sort of equality test (except,
obviously, a numerical one) to test their equality:

<p><pre>
  >> (setq a 'car)
  >> (setq b 'car)
  >> (eq a b)
  :: T 
</pre><p>

But that's not true for most other things.  Usually, complex things
are not actually the very same thing, they just LOOK the same.  Take
strings, for example: If you type "abc" and then type "abc" again you
get two similar strings, but they are not identical.  There is no
unique string "abc"; there are a potentially infinite number of
strings all of length 3 that contain the characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

<p><pre>
  >> (setq a "abc")
  >> (setq b "abc")
  >> (eq a b)
  :: NIL
</pre><p>

Nor is it true for numbers in Lisp.  There is no 'canonical' number
denoted by 1 in Lisp.  1's can be replicated all over Lisp's memory.
Same for characters.

<p>

This might seem arcane, but it's extremely important and useful!
Generally speaking, things <i>looking</i> alike is incidental.  For
example, Jeff Shrager and Jeff Elhai both have the first name "Jeff"
but they are different people.  They are EQUAL (at least in terms of
their first names), but not EQ.  EQUAL goes one more step than EQ, but
not as far as EQUALP.  EQUAL is actually pretty weird: it descends into
elements of lists and strings, but nothing else, while EQUALP will descend
into vectors and structures and other composite things as well.

<p><pre>
  >> (setq a "abc")
  >> (setq b "abc")
  >> (equal a b)
  :: T
</pre><p>

Equalp is the most powerful (or weakest, depending on your point of
view) kind of equality, descending recursively into pretty much
everything that it can, which is why it blows up trying to recursively
descend into frames.  It also ignores case when testing strings (like
STRING-EQUAL), unlike EQUAL (or STRING=).

<pre>
  >> (setq v1 #(1 2 3))
  >> (setq v2 #(1 2 3))
  >> (eq v1 v2)
  :: NIL
  >> (equal v1 v2)
  :: NIL
  >> (equalp v1 v2)
  :: T
</pre>

EQUAL and EQUALP implement two somewhat different notions of equality
that the definers of the Common Lisp language thought were very
useful.  That's good, except when you get confused about exactly which
one does what.  The nice thing about Lisp is that, if you don't like
these particular equality predicates, its really easy to write your
own!
<p>

Things that are unique, like symbols (e.g., 'CAR) you want to use EQ
as the test.  But you must be very sure they are unique -- that you
really want to test this unique sort of equality, and not just ask
whether they look alike.  Things that are not unique but which are
'atomic' you use EQL.  Things that are neither unique nor atomic
(i.e., they have subcomponents) you use EQUAL or EQUALP, depending on
exactly what semantics you want.  As a last result you can roll your
own equality function.

<p>

BTW, all programming languages have these different meanings of
equality.  Lisp just makes the problem more explicit than many, and
lets you do exactly what you want.  In some languages, you simply
can't distinguish between two strings that look alike.  Their loss!

<a name="TAG-OPTIMIZE"></a>
<h3>An example of how to speed up a slow program (conversation between
Jeff Elhai and JP, about Feb. 2004)</h3>

<pre>

(defun mismatches-between-slow (string1 string2 mismatches-allowed)
   (LET ((mismatches-found 0))
     (loop for i from 0 below (min (length string1) (length string2)) do
           (if (string= (subseq string1 i (1+ i)) (subseq string2 i (1+ i)))
               (incf mismatches-found))
           (if (> mismatches-found mismatches-allowed) (return nil))
           finally (return mismatches-found))))

[Jeff complains that this is very slow, compared to another implementation
using PPCRE, a pattern matcher written in Lisp ]

JP replies:

There are many problems with this.

First, did you compile WINDOW-MATCH-WITH-ERRORS?  Otherwise, you are
running an interpreted program against a highly optimized compiled
regular expression pattern matcher.

The biggest problem with this code is that it creates (conses) huge numbers
of temporary strings, whereas the pattern matcher most certainly does not.

Every time you do this:

  (IF (STRING= (SUBSEQ string1 i (1+ i)) (SUBSEQ string2 i (1+ i)))
      (INCF mismatches-found))

you are creating two temporary new strings (SUBSEQ always creates a
new string), when in fact you don't need to create any strings at all.
Notice that this is executing in the inner-inner loop of your code.

Instead, you could do this:

(if (char= (char string1 i) (char string2 i))
    (incf mismatches-found))

Another issue is that in order to write highly optimized lisp code,
you have to declare your variables, just like you have to declare
everything all the time in C or Java.  I'm not going to discuss this
further at the moment, but suffice to say this can make all the
difference in the world in the inner-inner loop of your code.

Another issue is that if you want the compiler to generate very
efficient code instead of generating code that does a lot of error
checking, you have to tell it to do so.  You may have seen the
following:

  (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0)))

at the beginning of some of my functions.  That's how you do it.

Now, you may be saying, "BLETCH, BARF, SPIT, COUGH".  Fair enough.

But one of the strong points of Lisp is that in order to get good
performance you ONLY have to worry about declarations in the
inner-inner loops of your code.  The rest of it can be coded as
quickly, elegantly and inefficiently as you like.

Now, I'm not saying that if we optimize the hell out of your program
it will run anywhere near as fast as the pattern matcher.  I don't
know. 

But the timings you did could easily be off by a factor of 3,10 or
even 100 from what could be obtained with a bit of work.

[[ As it later turned out, optimization made it FASTER than the
pattern matcher... ]]

Something to keep in mind.

One of the points or 'aims' of BioBike is sort of that the
implementers write the 'inner loops' of biologically important
algorithms, and we let Biologists go and write the outer loops.

Here is a comparison of an optimized version of MISMATCHES-BETWEEN
with your original code.  The FAST version runs somewhere around
60 times as fast as the SLOW version.

  (defun mismatches-between-fast
        (string1 string2 start1 end1 start2 end2 max-mismatches-allowed)
   (declare (simple-string string1 string2))
   (declare (fixnum start1 end1 start2 end2 max-mismatches-allowed))
   (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0)))
   (let ((count 0))
     (declare (fixnum count))
     (loop for i fixnum from start1 below end1
           for j fixnum from start2 below end2 do
           (when (eql (schar string1 i) (schar string2 j)) (incf count))
           (when (> count max-mismatches-allowed) (return))
           finally (return count)
           )))

(defun time-them (n)
   (declare (fixnum n))
   (time
    (loop for j fixnum below n do
          (mismatches-between-fast
           "asdlkfaldkfa" "aslflkfadddddd" 0 12 0 14 4)))
   (time
    (loop for j fixnum below n do
          (mismatches-between-slow
           "asdlkfaldkfa" "aslflkfadddddd" 4))))

<a name="TAG-STRINGS"></a>
<h3> Strings, characters in and out of strings, and escapes </h3>

<pre>

The backslash is Lisp's escape character.  So the string

"abc"

has exactly the same characters as the string

"\a\b\c"

To put a backslash in a string you have to escape the escape character:

"\\a\\\\b"

That's a string with five characters, a backslash, an 'a',  two more backslashes,
and a 'b'.

Also, #\\ is the single character backslash (as opposed to a string with a single
backslash character, "\\".  

(eql #\\ (char "\\" 0))  

You use the '#\' notation to represent characters OUTSIDE of double-quoted
strings.  The #\ notation is not recognized INSIDE of double quotes.

So "#\a"

is a string consisting of two characters, pound sign and the letter 'a'.

#\a

is the single character object, the letter a.

The #\ notation is not restricted to single character 'names'.
Certain characters have 'verbose' english names:

#\Space

is a valid character.

#\Newline

another.

To create a string with a Tab character in it you need to do something like

(one-string "abc" #\Tab "def")

(Note that ONE-STRING is a BIOBIKE macro, it's not Common Lisp per se.
The equivalent using Common Lisp primitives is

(concatenate 'string "abc" (string #\Tab) "def")

which might give you a clue as to why we invented ONE-STRING...

<a name="TAG-FLET-AND-FUNCALL"></a>
<h3> Why doesn't referring to a local function by name work
when using FUNCALL, MAPCAR, or similar functions? </h3>  

<p>
E.g, why does

<pre>
(defun foo ()
  (flet ((bar (y) (1+ y))
         (baz (z) (1- z)))
    (progn (baz 4) (mapcar 'bar '(1 2 3)))))

(foo)
</pre>
error out with an 'undefined function BAR' error 
(while the call to BAZ works just fine) ?
<p>

Basically, it's quirk of the definition of Common Lisp.  
Whenever you refer to a local function defined with FLET or LABELS other
than by calling it directly (as with BAZ, above) (such as with MAPCAR
or APPLY), you must use #' notation.  So changing the above MAPCAR call to

<pre>
(mapcar #'bar '(1 2 3))
</pre>

will work.

Note that if you refer to a function QUUX defined with DEFUN (which defines
a function globally), you can use either the 'QUUX or the #'QUUX notation.
