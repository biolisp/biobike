<p> Microarray data is typically stored in tab-delimited ascii files.
Data is stored one entry per row, and the tabs separate the columns
(or fields) of each entry.  (Often a field will contain text which has
spaces in it, so using tabs makes sense.)  On a line above the actual
data rows, a line naming the fields (again tab-delimited), must be
provided.

<p>
These files are more generally referred to as tables.  Here are two
example tables, the first of microarray data and the second a more
complicated looking one of a different genre.  Note that the lines
with dashes are NOT part of the actual file.

What is Barney's wife's name, anyway?
NAME and SSN will be KEY fields.

------------ END OF SECOND TABLE ---------------------------------------------

</pre>

In this tutorial we're only going to deal with the former kind of
table.  If you would like to learn how to read in and manipulate
tables of a more general sort like the latter table, see the documentation
entry entitled 'Table Reading Tools' under the 'More Advanced Materials'
section.

<p> Let's read in our simple, sample microarray data from above.
There are six data rows, and the names of the columns in our
microarray data table are "geneID", "15", "60", "360" and "900".

<pre>
 >> (setq syn6803 (load-organism "syn6803"))
 >> (setq my-table (read-microarray-table "biol:data;hihara-sample.tbl"
                                          :organism syn6803))
#&lt;COMMON-LISP-USER::TABLE-DATA 206146F4&gt
</pre>

And now let's describe it:

<pre>
BIOLISP 11 > (describe-table-data my-table :nrows 2)

;; Description of table object from file biol:data;hihara-sample.tbl:

;;   Table has 5 fields, with names:
;;     Column  1: geneID
;;     Column  2: 15
;;     Column  3: 60
;;     Column  4: 360
;;     Column  5: 900

;;   There are 4 data columns and 1 other columns.
;;     The data columns are: (1 2 3 4).
;;     The other columns are: (0).
;;   Table has 1 key field, in column (0):
;;     Key  1: geneID (in column 0)

;;   There are 6 rows of data in the table.

;;   Table data is of uniform type SINGLE-FLOAT.
;;   There are no missing data values in this table.

;; The first 2 rows of the table:

#(#$S6803.ssr3571 0.97 1.05 0.96 0.92) 
#(#$S6803.ssr3570 0.99 1.11 0.91 0.96) 
NIL
</pre> 

<p> 
It looks like the description is consistent with our table,
so all is well.  The notation '#(' means that the set of things that
follows is being stored in a one-dimensional array (aka a vector).
When more than one datum is retrieved from a table it is usually
returned as a vector.  The notation '#$' indicates a FRAME, as we've
previously learned.

<p> READ-MICROARRAY-TABLE reads in a table in this particular format
and no other: The first column is the gene name, and the rest of the
columns are floating point values.  The gene name is turned into a
FRAME (see the FRAMES tutorial or the introductory tutorial for more
discussion about frames), and the frame representing the gene is a KEY
value for this table.  Being a key value means that you can ask for
the data associated with that KEY by using the KEY, instead of using
the row number the data is to be found at.  Let's see this in action:

<pre>
 >> (table-data-data-row my-table 1)
#(0.99 1.11 0.91 0.96)

 >> (table-data-data-row my-table #$S6803.ssr3570)
#(0.99 1.11 0.91 0.96)
</pre>

Indeed, we get the data for row 1 back whether we ask for it by row number
or by KEY.  

<p> As you might expect, you can extract a single datum from the
table, a single row (as we just did), a single column, or multiple
rows or multiple columns.

<pre>
 >> (table-data-element my-table #$S6803.ssr3570 "360")
0.91

 >> (table-data-col my-table "60")
#(1.05 1.11 1.15 1.51 0.76 1.01)

 >> (table-data-data-rows my-table (list #$S6803.ssr3570 4))
(#(0.99 1.11 0.91 0.96) #(0.51 0.76 1.16 0.7))

 >> (table-data-cols my-table (list "geneID" "15"))
(#(#$S6803.ssr3571 #$S6803.ssr3570 #$S6803.ssr3532 #$S6803.ssr3467 #$S6803.ssr3465 #$S6803.ssr3451)
 #(0.97 0.99 1.46 1.08 0.51 0.8))

</pre>

<p>
A more general function to extract information from a table is called
TABLE-DATA-SELECT.  The more general something is, often the more complicated
its description, and TABLE-DATA-SELECT is no exception.  But here is a
fairly simple example which extracts the rows of table whose first two
data values both exceed 1.0.

<pre>

 >>  (table-data-select
       my-table
       #'(lambda (v) (and (> (aref v 0) 1.0) (> (aref v 1) 1.0)))
      :return :entire-record)

(#(#$S6803.ssr3532 1.46 1.15 1.21 0.88) #(#$S6803.ssr3467 1.08 1.51 0.98 0.84))

</pre>

<p>

(The "#'(lambda" notation is simply a way of defining a function
within an expression without having to bother giving it a name.
In this case the function being defined is given the data vector
for each row and tests whether the first and second elements of
that data vector are both greater than 1.0.)

<p>

There are numerous other functions which extract data, create
subtables, and access information about a table (such as the number of
rows it has).  Descriptions of all these functions can be found in the
detailed documentation for the table data facility.

<p>

Now that we can get data into tables, and get rows etc. out of these
tables, let's do something interesting with them.  The simplest thing
to do is to plot the data in the table.  There are a number of "smart"
plotting functions in BioLingua that try to figure out how to plot
data in a variety of formats. Let's try some simple plotting:

<p>
<pre>
  >> (line-plot '((numbers 1.141 2.718 3.141)))
</pre>
<p>

If this works right, you should get a nice plot of the numbers, with
the label "numbers" in a legend.  How about a few lists of numbers:

<p>
<pre>
  >> (line-plot '((n1 1.141 2.718 3.141) (n2 7 3 1)))
</pre>
<p>

Okay, that was easy.  Here's a variation that we'll use in a little
while:

<p>
<pre>
  >> (line-plot '((1.141 2.718 3.141) (7 3 1)) :labels '(n1 n2))
</pre>
<p>

That should come out just the same, but note that we gave the labels
as a keyword argument instead of the labels being the first thing in
each sublist.

<p>

Line-plot can conveniently display the data that you get out of
tables, too.  Remember this:

<p>
<pre>
 >> (table-data-data-rows my-table (list #$S6803.ssr3570 4))
 :: (#(0.99 1.11 0.91 0.96) #(0.51 0.76 1.16 0.7))
</pre>
<p>

Do that again, and then try:

<p>
<pre>
 >> (line-plot * :labels (list #$S6803.ssr3570 4))
</pre>
<p>

Let's put that together into a function. (Enter this into the
expression box and then press EVAL.)

<p>
<pre>
(defun plot-table-rows (rows)
 (line-plot (table-data-data-rows my-table rows)
            :labels rows))
</pre>
<p>

Now try:

<p>
<pre>
  >> (plot-table-rows (list #$S6803.ssr3570 4))
</pre>
<p>

By the way, notice that you can click on the graphs to download them
(right click and "Save picture as..."), or, if you just left click on
them you get the data itself!

<p>

Let's try something a little more complex.  Remember this:

<p>
<pre>

  >>  (table-data-select
        my-table
        #'(lambda (v) (and (> (aref v 0) 1.0) (> (aref v 1) 1.0)))
        :return :entire-record)

  :: (#(#$S6803.ssr3532 1.46 1.15 1.21 0.88) #(#$S6803.ssr3467 1.08 1.51 0.98 0.84))

Let's just try plotting these results:

  >> (line-plot *)

</pre>
<p>

Line-plot figured out that since you didn't give labels, you intended
the gene ids as the labels. This kind of smarts can be a little
confusing if you forget to put the labels.  Watch:

<p>
<pre>
  >> (line-plot '((1 3 2 4 5) (6 4 5 3 2)))
</pre>
<p>

Notice that we lost the first number in each list, and it was used as
the label.  You probably meant something like this:

<p>
<pre>
  >> (line-plot '((1 3 2 4 5) (6 4 5 3 2)) :labels '(first second))
</pre>
<p>
