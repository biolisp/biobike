    <h2>LISPSCRIPT</h2>
    <a name='s1q1'></a>
    <h3>What is Lispscript?</h3>
    <p>Lispscript is a Lisp dialect that compiles to Javascript so it can be
    run in browsers. It does not aim for conformance with any existing
    Lisp dialect (e.g. Common Lisp or Scheme).</p>
    <a name='s1q2'></a>
    <h3>How do I use Lispscript?</h3>
    <p>You write  files which are then compiled into 
    files by AllegroServe when the  file is requested by the
    browser. You then load the generated  files in your HTML
    with the <code>script</code> tag.</p>
    <a name='s1q3'></a>
    <h3>How do names translate from Lispscript into Javascript?</h3>
    <p>Lispscript is read with a case-sensitive reader so you can use normal
    Javascript names such as <code>getElementById</code>. But Lispscript also
    takes advantage of the fact that <code>-</code> is not a legal character in
    Javascript names to support a bit of syntactic sugar: lispy names like
    <code>get-element-by-id</code> are translated into Javascript names by the
    simple algorithm of removing all <code>-</code>'s and upcasing the following
    letter.</p>
    <a name='s1q4'></a>
    <h3>What special forms and macros from Common Lisp can I use in Lispscript?</h3>
    <p>TK</p>
    <a name='s1q5'></a>
    <h3>How do macros work in Lispscript (can I use backquote and comma, can I use DEFMACRO)?</h3>
    <p>You can write Lispscript macros. However, they are written in Common
    Lisp, not Lispscript. At the moment there is no way to include macros
    in  files. Instead you use the
    <code>DEFINE-JAVASCRIPT-MACRO</code> macro which is defined as part of the
    <code>COM.GIGAMONKEYS.FOO.JAVASCRIPT</code> package. This is not entirely
    convenient, assuming you are using the standard <code>:upcase</code>
    readtable case as Lispscript identifiers that you want to include in
    generated code need to be lowercase, and thus will need to be written
    escaped, which means macros tend to look like this:</p>
    <pre>
(define-javascript-macro |when| (test &amp;body body)
  `(|if| ,test (|progn| ,@body)))
    </pre>
    <a name='s1q6'></a>
    <h3>What functions from Common Lisp can I use in Lispscript?</h3>
    <p>TK</p>
    <a name='s1q7'></a>
    <h3>What data types can I use in Lispscript? How do they get translated when I send them across to the sever.</h3>
    <p>Lispscript doesn't support any datatypes that are not part of
    Javascript. At the moment the only mechanism for sending data between
    Common Lisp and Lispscript is to send XML documents via the Ajax
    machinery. Lispscript provides an <code>xml</code> macro that eases the pain
    of building XML documents on the Lispscript side (compared to the
    Javascript code necessary to build an XML document using the DOM) and
    those XML documents can be parsed into s-expressions on the Lisp side
    using any XML parser such as the parser provided by Allegro.</p>
    <a name='s1q8'></a>
    <h3>What data types can I send from the server back to the Lispscript client?  How do they get translated?</h3>
    <p>Again, communication between the two sides is done in terms of XML. At
    the moment parsing the contents of the XML into Javascript objects is
    left up to application code though we have some ideas about how to
    ease that burden.</p>
    <a name='s1q9'></a>
    <h3>Can I use something like DEFSTRUCT in Lispscript? CLOS?</h3>
    <p>No. However you can use Javascript's native prototype-based object
    system. But there is no special support for that in Lispscript other
    than two bits of syntax. Methods can be invoked by using a name
    starting with dot like this:</p>
    <pre>
(.foo obj 1 2 3)
    </pre>
    <p>which is translated into this Javascript:</p>
    <pre>
obj.foo(1, 2, 3)
    </pre>
    <p>And fields can be accessed using the <code>@</code> operator:</p>
    <pre>
(@ obj x)
    </pre>
    <p>is translated into:</p>
    <pre>
obj.x 
    </pre>
    <a name='s1q10'></a>
    <h3>What are the gotchas in writing Lispscript?</h3>
    <p>You tell me.</p>
    <a name='s1q11'></a>
    <h3>What happens when an error occurs in Lispscript? How do I debug?</h3>
    <p>At the moment debugging Lispscript is pretty much the same as
    debugging Javascript with the added hassle that the browser only knows
    about the generated Javascript, not the actual Lispscript source. The
    basic Javascript debugging tools are alert boxes and the Javascript
    console (<code>Tools-&gt;JavaScript Console</code> in Firefox).</p>
    <p>As a very slight aid to using the former, Lispscript provides a macro
    <code>debug</code>, a thin layer over the Javascript function <code>alert()</code>
    that takes care of concatenating together all its arguments and which
    also makes it obvious which bits of code are debugging output and
    which one are actual alerts that should be left in the code. Thus you
    can write:</p>
    <pre>
(debug "foo: " foo "; bar: " bar)
    </pre>
    <p>instead of:</p>
    <pre>
(alert (+ "foo: " foo "; bar: " bar))
    </pre>
    <p>Of course if your Javascript is failing mysteriously and isn't getting
    to you carefully crafted <code>debug</code> calls, then you have no choice
    but to look in the Javascript console. Be aware, however, that errors
    reported in the Javascript console will contain line numbers pointing
    to the offending code in the generated Javascript; at the moment it's
    up to you map that back to the corresponding location in the
    Lispscript source.</p>
    <a name='s1q12'></a>
    <h3>Is there a way for me to translate my Lispscript file into Javascript from inside my Lisp process, instead of waiting to detect a syntax error via translation triggered by invoking the Javascript URL?</h3>
    <a name='s1q13'></a>
    <h3>What is an example of a simple Lispscript function?</h3>
    <pre>
(defun factorial (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (1- n)))))
    </pre>
    <a name='s1q14'></a>
    <h3>What is a simple example of an HTML page and a Lispscript file, such that the HTML calls a function in the Lispscript file?</h3>
    <p>HTML (<code>hello.html</code>)</p>
    <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="hello.js"/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload="hello();"/&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>Lispscript (<code>hello.ls</code>):</p>
    <pre>
(defun hello ()
  (debug "hello, world!"))
    </pre>
    <a name='s1q15'></a>
    <h3>What are some common examples of DOM manipulation using Lispscript?</h3>
    <pre>
(defun update-result (text)
  (let ((result (.get-element-by-id document "result")))
    (set (@ result value) text)))
    </pre>
    <p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind when translating
    Javascript DOM into Lispscript.  Even though both methods and
    attributes are specified with the dot operator in Javascript, the
    mechanism is a bit different in Lispscript.  For example:</p>
    <pre>
var node = document.getElementById("element-name");
var value = node.value;
    </pre>
    <p>In both lines, the dot operator is used.  In the first, it is used to
    specify a method to be called on the document object.  In the second,
    it is used to specify an attribute of the node object.  Lispscript
    will look a bit different:</p>
    <pre>
(let* ((node (.get-element-by-id document "element-name"))
       (value (@ node value))))
    </pre>
    <p>When node is bound, the object method is specified with a dot before
    the name. But when an attribute of node is accessed, we use the '@'
    operator. This is an important different to keep in mind, because in
    Javascript the dot notation does not clarify this. An easy way to
    remember is if you needed parentheses and possibly arguments in
    Javascript, it will be a dot-function in Lispscript. If you need a dot
    operator but <i>no</i> parentheses in Javascript, you probably need the
    '@' notation to access the class/object member or attribute.</p>
    <a name='s1q16'></a>
    <h3>How do I use Lispscript code in a web page?</h3>
    <p>To use Lispscript file in a web page you need to include a
    <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with a <code>src</code> attribute naming the file except
    with a  extension. On the Lisp side, a function registered
    with AllegroServe will look for a file with the same name but with a
     extension in each of the directories listed in the variable
    <code>COM.BIOBIKE.AJAX:*AJAX-DIRECTORIES*</code>. When it finds the
     file, it will compile it into a  file and serve
    that file to the browser.</p>
    <a name='s1q17'></a>
    <h3>Where are the Lispscript tests and how do I run them?</h3>
    <p>After you load the system, in your Lisp, change directory (i.e. ,cd in
    SLIME or setf <span class='CL'>*DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*</span>) to
    <code>BioLisp/ThirdParty/monkeylib/foo/</code> and run the function:</p>
    <pre>
(com.gigamonkeys.foo.lispscript-tests::maketests)
    </pre>
    <p>This will produce a file <code>lispscript-tests.html</code> and a Javascript
    file <code>lispscript-test-cases.js</code> in the <code>foo</code> directory. Load
    <code>lispscript-tests.html</code> in your browser and you should see a
    table of test cases, showing a Lispscript expression, the Javascript
    it compiles into, expected value, actual value, and a pass/fail
    indicator. At the top of the page it should say:</p>
    <pre>
Passes: 141; Failures: 0 &mdash; All tests completed.
    </pre>
    <p>If not, something is wrong. If it still says "All tests completed" you
    can look in the table for red rows&mdash;those are the failures. If it says
    "Tests didn't complete" that means there was a deeper Javascript error
    and you'll need to look in the Javascript console to see what's going
    on. The tests should all pass in Firefox (and also Safari). It'd be
    interesting to see how they do in other browsers.</p>
    <p>You can add test cases by editing the file
    <code>lispscript-test-cases.txt</code>. The format of this file is a line
    containing a Lispscript expression followed by a line containing a
    Javascript expression. The Lispscript expression will be compiled into
    Javascript and run and the resulting value compared to the value
    produced by evaluating the Javascript expression. These pairs can be
    separated with blank lines and lines starting with semicolons. After
    you edit it, invoke <code>maketests</code> again to regenerate the html and
    Javascript files.</p>
    <h2>AJAX</h2>
    <a name='s2q1'></a>
    <h3>What is Ajax?</h3>
    <p>Ajax is a shorthand name for techniques based on combining Javascript,
    XML, CSS, and DHTML to produce browser-based applications that broke
    out out of the "everything-happens-on-page-reload" model of the early
    web. It is not, according to Jesse James Garrett who coined the term
    inn a
    <a href='http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php'>February 2005 essay</a>, an acronym and thus is written "Ajax"
    rather than "AJAX".</p>
    <a name='s2q2'></a>
    <h3>How do I initiate a request to the server from Lispscript using Ajax?</h3>
    <p>First, create the message to be sent. You can create a message in
    plain text using 'make-simple-message-for-app' with the name of your
    application and the text to send:</p>
    <pre>
(make-simple-message-for-app "YOUR-APP-NAME-HERE" your-message-text)
    </pre>
    <p>Alternatively, you can create an XML message:</p>
    <pre>
(make-message-for-app 
   "YOUR-APP-NAME-HERE" (xml (:stuff (:you "like") (:here "abc"))))
    </pre>
    <p>Then, send the message you just created:</p>
    <pre>
(.send channel your-message-here)
    </pre>
    <a name='s2q3'></a>
    <h3>How do I set up a handler function on the server to handle an Ajax client request?</h3>
    <p>Define a function that takes as its arguments a channel and a message.
    The channel will be used to respond to the message. The message itself
    will have the application name as its first item, and then the message
    contents as the second:</p>
    <pre>
(defun server-handler-function (channel message) ...)
    </pre>
    <p>Then register this function:</p>
    <pre>
(register-message-handler :your-app-name 'server-handler-function)
    </pre>
    <p>NB: You do not need to know any details about the channel object.
    This object is created when 'http.js' is loaded by the browser, and is
    a complex Javascript class designed to abstract away the asynchronous
    nature of Ajax messaging.  You just need to know that message handlers
    on the server side will receive a channel as their first argument, and
    must use the channel to send a response.</p>
    <a name='s2q4'></a>
    <h3>How do I send back a response to an Ajax client from the handler function?</h3>
    <p>Use the channel that was passed in when the handler was called, along
    with the 'send' function:</p>
    <pre>
(send channel (list :your-app-name response))
    </pre>
    <a name='s2q5'></a>
    <h3>How do I define a handler in Lispscript in the browser to deal with a response from a server handler function?</h3>
    <p>Create a Lispscript function that takes a message as an argument. The
    'textContent' attribute of the message can be accessed for the message
    text, or you can use DOM methods. Then register this handler:</p>
    <pre>
(.register-message-handler channel "your-app-name" your-handler-function)
    </pre>
    <p>Again, the <code>channel</code> object is an instance of a Javascript
    Channel class which was created when the browser loaded
    <code>http.js</code>. All you really need to know about it is that it
    uniquely identifies a browser connection to the server, and is used to
    send Ajax messages to handler functions on the server.</p>
    <a name='s2q6'></a>
    <h3>What do I need to know about the asynchronous nature of the Ajax browser/server communications channel?</h3>
    <p>Messages are not exactly like function calls. The call to 
    will return right away and you can continue executing more code in the
    browser and the browser will continue to respond to UI events as well
    as to messages coming from the server. In general, you should try to
    think in terms of self-contained messages being sent between the
    browser and the server: you may send a message to the server that will
    cause it to do some work and send a message back but the message that
    comes back should, ideally, be something the code in the browser can
    handle without having to keep track of any context. Typically you can
    arrange for the message from the server to contain whatever context
    information the browser code will need to deal with the message.</p>
    <a name='s2q7'></a>
    <h3>How do I define a handler in Lispscript in the browser to deal with asynchronous messages from the server</h3>
    <p>E.g., a status line or stock ticker which only changes when some
    real-world event happens which is random)</p>
    <a name='s2q8'></a>
    <h3>How would I package and send the lisp data (("foo" 3) ("bar" 54)) to Lispscript?</h3>
    <p>At the moment there's no automatic way to do that. In general
    Ajax-based apps should be written in terms of "messages" with named
    slots rather than arbitrary Lisp data. For instance the REPL
    application sends messages back and forth that look (in sexp-xml)
    like:</p>
    <pre>
(:repl (:input "(+ 1 2 3)"))
    </pre>
    <p>and </p>
    <pre>
(:repl (:output "6"))
    </pre>
    <p>The outermost tag is handled on the Lispscript side by the
    application-level message dispatcher so the actual message handler only
    has to deal with the <code>(:input ...)</code> and <code>(:output ...)</code>
    parts of the message.</p>
    <a name='s2q9'></a>
    <h3>How would I define a data structure in Lispscript to receive it?</h3>
    <p>This part is a bit trickier.  The response will be placed in an xml
    structure for you, but you have the responsibility to parse it.  This
    is not really difficult, you just need to get the details correct.</p>
    <a name='s2q10'></a>
    <h3>What would the code look like to actually receive such a data structure?</h3>
    <pre>
(defun foobar-on-message (message)
  (let ((message-type (@ message node-name)))
    (cond
      ((string= message-type "input")
       (do-stuff-with-input (@ message text-content)))
      ((string= message-type "output")
       (do-stuff-with-output (@ message text-content))))))
    </pre>
    <p>The actual message that came in will be of the form:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;application-name&gt;&lt;input&gt;...&lt;/input&gt;&lt;/application-name&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>or</p>
    <pre>
&lt;application-name&gt;&lt;output&gt;...&lt;/output&gt;&lt;/application-name&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>but the <code>application-name</code> element will have been stripped off by
    the application-level message dispatcher which then passes the payload
    to the registered callback, assuming <code>foobar-on-message</code> was
    registered with the channel like this:</p>
    <pre>
(.register-message-handler channel "application-name" foobar-on-message)
    </pre>
    <a name='s2q11'></a>
    <h3>What is a simple example of a complete html page, Lispscript file, server side handler definition and handler function?</h3>
    <p>See the <code>ajax-howto.txt</code> file in the <code>.../BioLisp/Ajax/</code>
    directory.</p>
    <a name='s2q12'></a>
    <h3>Is there a limit on the number of requests the client can have pending? </h3>
    <p>Depends what you mean by requests. Our Ajax infrastructure is built
    around asynchronous messages, not synchronous requests. Both the
    server and the client can send messages to each other whenever they
    want but the call to <code>send</code> returns immediately.</p>
    <p>At the application level it may make sense to think of one message
    being a "response" to another message&mdash;for instance in the Ajax REPL,
    the browser sends a message to the server containing an expression to
    be evaluated and the server then sends back a response containing the
    result&mdash;but that is purely an application-level matter. A single
    message from the client to the server could cause the server to send
    zero, one, or more messages "in response". And the server can send
    messages to a client out of the blue.</p>
    <p>On the browser side this model is completely natural since all the
    code in an HTML page runs in a singly threaded event loop anyway.
    Normal Javascript code, without Ajax, spends most of its time doing
    nothing and periodically some action by the user will generate an
    event which causes some event-handler code in the page to run and
    until the event-handler function returns no more events can be
    processed. So Javascript (and Lispscript) code is typically written to
    respond to events by doing something to update the state of the web
    page, either in a user-visible way or some internal data structure,
    and then returning. If an event handler blocked, say by busy-waiting
    in a loop waiting for some change in state that would be caused by
    another event handler, it would never unblock because no other
    event-handler would ever get a chance to run.</p>
    <p>When we add our Ajax infrastructure to the mix, it simply adds another
    thing that the client-side code can do (send messages) and another
    kind of event to which it can respond (incoming messages).</p>
    <p>On the server side, the Ajax infrastructure uses the same basic
    model&mdash;when a message comes in from the client it is dispatched to the
    appropriate message handler which must process the message and return
    before any more messages can be received from that client.<sup>1</sup> If the server needs to do something that
    could block, or that might take a long time, and the app needs the
    client to be able to send more messages in the meantime, the
    server-side event handler needs to pass that work off to another
    thread so the message handler can return and acknowledge receipt of
    the message.<sup>2</sup></p>
    <a name='s2q13'></a>
    <h3>Does it make sense to operate the Ajax interface in a simple request/wait-for-reply mode from the client's point of view?</h3>
    <p>No, but this has more to do with Javascript's single-threaded
    threading model than anything else. There's no way to "wait" in
    Javascript&mdash;everything is driven by events. Our Ajax infrastructure
