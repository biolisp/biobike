<h4>What is a Knowledge Operating System?</h4>

<p>

<b>In one paragraph</b>:

<p>

Whereas Unix and Windows are operating systems for ASCII strings and
files, and there are operating systems for tables (such as Oracle), a
knowledge operating System (or "KnowOS") is an operating systems for
knowledge!  The current <a target=_blank href=index.html>BioBike</a>
implementation has many of the facilities of an operating system,
including an integrated file system and multi-processing, but the
representational basis for BioBike is knowledge, not files or tables.

<p>

<b>In more detail</b>:

<p>

Both operating systems and programming languages use abstraction to
provide services such as data management, user and process isolation
and intercommunication, and interfaces to hardware services and to
other software. In historical practice, the broad concepts of
operating systems and programming languages overlap with one another
in a variety of ways. For example, since one of the most important
services provided by operating systems is application integration --
the ability to pass the results of one application program on to
another -- operating systems often provide custom "scripting
languages" for this purpose. Deriving from IBM's Job Control Language
(JCL) in the 60s, the concept was popularized by Unix shell scripts,
and has evolved a number of rich languages such as Python.

<P>

Both scripting languages and full-strength programming languages
define a virtual environment consisting of abstract objects and
operations to manipulate them. They differ primarily in the nature of
their domain of objects, and in their sense of the persistence of
their data state. Scripting languages generally range over persistent
object spaces composed of relatively simple objects. The objects in
Unix are files organized into directories, and these are highly
persistent. Similarly, relational database management systems
(RDBMSs), such as Oracle, range over persistent tables. Contrast this
with classical programming where what one does is to build up networks
of complex structured "intermediate" knowledge, use these in
calculations, and then drop them when the program terminates.

<P>

It is now widely recognized that networks of complex structured
knowledge are critical to modern software applications, but the tools
contained in mainstream languages and operating systems are not
particularly oriented towards this type of data. Operating systems
deal mainly with serial files, programming languages deal with
networks of objects but do not provide persistence. RDBMs provide
persistence but are poor at dealing with complex, evolving ,
messily-structured domains. Herein lies the vision that we call a
knowledge operating system or "KnowOS": Complex persistent knowledge
should be the fundamental domain of both the user interface (UI) and
of the way that programs interact with one another (i.e., the API).

<P>

The central idea of a knowledge operating system is that knowledge --
that is, arbitrarily complex, interconnected, semi-structured data of
all types -- is omnipresent. This knowledge is immediately and easily
available to both users and programs at all times, and the user is, or
appears to be, "living in" this universe, just as the user of Unix
lives in the directory tree, and the user of Oracle lives in a world
of tables. All of this knowledge should be manipulable through an
equally-omnipresent programming language through which one can easily
and efficiently work with complex knowledge structures. In this
vision, everything known to the OS is a part of the knowledge
space, basic data, programs, process objects, long text objects
(analogous to files), etc., and the programming language has access to
all of these objects equally. The classical example of what we have
thus far described is the Lisp Machine, variously instantiated at MIT
and Xerox PARC in the 70s and 80s.  But these did had significant
limitations, esp. running on special-purpose hardware, and in the
modern world one wants to be able to access knowledge via The Web.
