a set of shorthand buttons that I can set to various things and then
just press to get the effect (Can sort of do this by keeping multiple
inputs in the EVAL field -- only the top one is actually evaled!)

some means of download (other than emailing to oneself) (looses
tabs!!) -- note that you can right click > download to get the file
from the browser -- this preserves the tabs

editor buttons (esp. indent) should appear both at the top and bottom
of the page

simplified table handling for simplest (grab a column from a tab)

various ways of sorting files in the internal dired pages (e.g., by
date)

need a way to move a file, esp. to/from a subdir.

multiple file upload? and "fast" table upload (where you give the name
of a variable, and the table "appears" in your world (and each time
you login!) by magic... that is, it goes into a magical .data subdirectory.

Should be able to Save/Compile/Load w/o leaving the editor window
(useful when you want to keep the editor around -- I do this now by
doing S/C/L and then immediately hitting "Prev" -- this screws with
the history numbering, but works.
