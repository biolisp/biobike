<a name=Introduction>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

BioBike is the environment in which you write and execute BioLisp
code, and BioLisp is a dialect of Common Lisp (which is, I'll bet you
can guess, a dialect of Lisp).  Before you can interact with BioBike,
you need to know a few basic facts about Lisp.  There are various web
sites dedicated to Lisp and learning Lisp.  You can find some of these
through <a href=http://www.lisp.org/alu/home> the Association of Lisp
Users (ALU) web site</a>, <a href=http://www.franz.com> the Franz web
site</a> (a commercial Common Lisp vendor), or <a
href=http://www.biolisp.org> the BioLisp.org site</a>, but you don't
need to learn much Lisp to begin working in the BioBike environment;
knowing just a few basics will get you jump started. In this tutorial
we'll do some very simple things with BioLisp in order to get you
comfortable with both interaction with the BioBike "listener" (the web
interface, aka the 'Weblistener'), and at the same time we'll see a
little bit of what BioLisp is about.

<p>

Nearly everything you do in BioLisp will involve sets of nested,
balanced, parentheses.  These are variously called "lists", "trees",
or "exprs" ("expressions").  When you tell BioLisp to do something,
The operation or function always comes first.  For example, if you
want to add two numbers in other programming languages you'd usually
type something like: 3 + 4, but in BioLisp you type: (+ 3 4).

<p>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=lists>
<h2>Lists</h2>

Let's start with lists. Here are some examples of correctly formed
lists:

<p>
<pre>
  (this is a list of symbols)

  (3.141 2.718 1.414) 

  (the above is a list of numbers)

  ((this) (is) (a) (list) (of other lists))

This one's several lines long:

  ((((this) (is (a ((deeply nested) list) see) if (you (can))
     (((follow all) the) matching parens) all the way)
          back up (to (the top)))))
</pre>
</p>

Here are some <i>wrong</i> lists (because none of them have correctly
balanced parentheses:

<p>
<pre>
  (this one does not have a close parentheses

  this one does not have an open parenthesis)

  ((this (one has) too many close parentheses)))))
</pre>
</p>

You have to be careful that you've balanced the parentheses correctly,
and that you've put them where you want them!  Most Lisp editors,
including the BioBike Listener, have some way of helping you balance
your parens, but it's important to understand that although you can
usually make the parens balance by just adding or removing some parens
at the end of the expression, this isn't always what you want!  We'll
see some example of this soon.

<p><hr><p>
<a name=exprs>
<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>

To compute things, you type in expressions (herafter known as
"exprs").  BioLisp follows your directions (e.g., when you  type
(+ 3 4) you are telling BioLisp to add 3 and 4), and returns the
result of your instructions, in this case 7.

<p>

Now, although (+ 3 4) is an expr, the the lists above aren't exprs --
that is, they are data lists, not expressions that specify
instructions.  If you try to get BioLisp to do something with one of
them (by typing it in) BioLisp will come back and tell you it doesn't
understand what you want it to do.  Notice the interesting fact that
expr lists look almost exactly the same as data lists, but they tell
Lisp to actually compute something -- the first element of the expr (+
3 4) is an instruction that Lisp understands, in this case: '+'.

<p>

Here are some examples of exprs.  We've indicated the expr with a ">>"
before it, and the result with a "::" before it.  
<p>

<font color="red">
[<i>Important!</i> When entering things into BioBike, make sure that
you don't type the leading ">>" characters!  These aren't part of the
expression; ">>" is just a presentation convention for the BioBike
tutorials! So in these tutorials, inputs are prefixed by ">>", and
outputs by "::", but, again, you should <i>NOT</i> type the ">>" when
you enter things into BioBike!]</font>

<p>

<pre>
>> (+ 1 2)
:: 3

>> (* 1 2 3 4)
:: 24

>> (* (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4))
:: 21
</pre>

</p>

Let's look at the first two exprs above.  These are obviously just
simple arithmetic expressions.  The only thing that's a little weird
is that the function (+ or *) comes before the arguments.  This is the
way Lisp <i>always</i> works: The first thing in an expression is the
function, and everything after that are the arguments:

<pre>
  (function arg1 arg2 arg3 ...)
</pre>

[The 'arguments' are the things that the function operates on, so,
with respect to the '+' function, the 'arguments' are the numbers
being added up.]

<p> 

At first this will seem a little weird to you; Why not just write:
1+2, or 1+2+3+4?  But if you think about it a little, you'll see that
Lisp syntax (which is called "prefix" notation), can be clearer and
more useful than the way you learned it (you learned: 1 + 2, which is
called "infix" notation).  When you use infix, you have to worry about
operator precedence -- that is, what gets done first. (Like, does
1+2*3 = 7 or 9?, that is: (1+2)*3 or 1+(2*3)???.) You have to
disambiguate infix using parentheses. Also, in infix you can't operate
on more than two arguments at a time -- to add four numbers you need 3
operations (a + b + c + d), while with prefix you just need one
operation (+ a b c d). So in the long run prefix turns out to be both
less ambiguous and in many cases shorter. 


<p>

I have to admit that for simple math prefix is kind of clunky, but it
has many other advantages.  One is that prefix more like the way you
actually <i>think</i>. Think about what you say when you talk about
math: You say something like: "three plus five" (this is infix), but
you could also say: "add three and five" (this is prefix).  For
<i>non-mathematical</i> things <i>prefix</i> is the more common way to
say things, and infix is quite rare!  When you give commands in
English you don't say: "ball give John" (infix -- weird!), you say:
"Give John the ball" (prefix -- normal!).  If you're
<i>describing</i> what's happening, you might use infix: "The ball is
given to John". But for commands, the verb usually comes first: "Give
John the ball." "Give the ball to John." "Eat the sticky rice with the
wooden chipsticks."  "Add 3, 4, 2, and 12."  "Multiply the result of
adding 1 and 2, to the result of adding 3 and 4." Etc.

<p>

As we get more into Lisp we'll come across more and more advantages of
prefix notation; for the moment, just bear with me on this.

<p>

This last sentence: "Multiply the result of adding 1 and 2, to the
result of adding 3 and 4." is how we read the third example, above:

<pre>
>> (* (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4))
:: 21
</pre>

Where there are both multiplication and addition combined. In infix
you could write: (1+2)*(3+4), except that in Lisp, by the above rule,
the function always comes before the arguments, so you write each
addition as: (+ 1 2) and (+ 3 4), as in the first example, and then in
order to multiply those together, you put them in as the arguments to
a multiplication, that is: (* (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)), which is the same as:
(* 3 7) = 21.

<p><hr><p>
<a name=eval>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>

The way to read exprs, and figure out what they're going to do -- that
is, how they <i>evaluate</i> -- is to read them from the front, and
ask at each level what the function is, and then what the values of it
arguments are.  Let's try that with the first expression: (+ 1 2):

<pre>
How to read: (+ 1 2):
The function is + (addition), so what are its arguments?
  The first argument is 1.  Okay, that's just a number.
  The second argument is 2.  Okay, that's just a number.
No more arguments; we can evaluate the + with it's arguments: (+ 1 2)
The result is 3
and we're done!
</pre>
<p>

This is called "recursive evaluation".  Now let's do exactly the same
thing with (* (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)):

<p>
<pre>
Recursive evaluation of: (* (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)):
The function is * (multiply), so what are its arguments?<br>
  The first argument is actually another expression: (+ 1 2),
  so we do just like above:
    The function is + (addition), so what are its arguments?
      The first argument is 1.  Okay, that's just a number.
      The second argument is 2.  Okay, that's just a number.
    No more arguments; we can evaluate the + with it's arguments: (+ 1 2)
    = 3
    and we're done!... at least with the first argument to *, which is 3.
  The second argument is another expression: (+ 3 4), so as above,
  we go through the evalauation of this sub-expression:
    The function is + (addition), so what are its arguments?
      The first argument is 3.  Okay, that's just a number.
      The second argument is 4.  Okay, that's just a number.
    No more arguments; we can evaluate the + with it's arguments: (+ 3 4)
    = 7
    and we're done with the second argument to *, which is 7.
So now we've evaluated both of the arguments to *, which are 
expressions that evaluate to 3 and 7, so we can complete the
multiplication: (* 3 7) 
= 21
and we're done!
</pre>

<p>

This seems complex (or at least verbose!), but when you get used to it
you'll find that it's actually very easy to follow, and
<i>incredibly</i> convenient in many ways.  Here are some others to
try out.  See if you can figure out what they evaluate to before
trying them::

<p>
<pre>
>> (* (+ 3 4) (* 2 3))

>> (- (- 3 4) (- 2 3))

>> (+ (* (+ 2 3) (* (+ 3 4) 2 (- 1 3))) (+ 3 4))
</pre>
<p>

(If you got -133 for the last one, you're better than me!  I did
something wrong when I was running through that one by hand and got
152; Oh well, that's why we actully let computers do this sort of
thing most of the time!  Go ahead and try it out by entering the last
one into Biobike!)

<p>

Now, let's look at a couple of problem cases.  The most common problem
that you'll run into is incorrectly parenthesized lists.  We saw some
simple examples above where there were just missing parens at the
beginning or end, but now you can see what I was saying about it not
being enough to just balanced the parens -- you have to balance them
CORRECTLY or else you'll get something that doesn't mean what you want
it to mean!  

<p>
Watch this!  Try each of these in BioBike: 

<p>
<pre>
>> (+ (* (+ 2 3) (* (+ 3 4) 2 (- 1 3))) (+ 3 4))
:: -133

>> (+ (* (+ 2 3) (* (+ 3 4 2 (- 1 3)))) (+ 3 4))
:: 42

>> (+ (* (+ 2 3) (* (+ 3 4 2 (- 1 3 (+ 3 4))))))
:: 0
</pre>
<p>

Yow!  All of those have <i>exactly the same characters</i>, and the
parens are all balanced, and the functions and arguments are in
<i>exactly the same order</i>!  But by just changing where the
parentheses go, you can get <i>completely different results</i>!
Moreover, it's easy to make things that just don't make any sense,
like:

<p>
<pre>
>> (* (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4))
:: 21

>> (* (+ 1 2 + 3 4))
:: Error: `+' is not of the expected type `NUMBER'
</pre>
<p>

Oops!  This time by leaving out a set of parentheses we tried to add a
non-number -- the plus sign! -- together with a bunch of numbers.

<p>

So far we've been working entirely with numbers, but there are three
other basic types of data in Lisp: strings, symbols, and
lists. (So that makes four, including numbers.)

<p>

Numbers are the obvious things: 1, 3.141, 1e-10, 3.5d-35, etc.  (The
'e' and 'd' notations are two different ways to denote scientific
notation.  Although you're probably more used to the 'e' form, the 'd'
form will be useful for writing extremely small numbers.  This will be
clear later on when we're talking about blast e-values. For now, just
get that 'e' and 'd' are both ways to specify scientific notation.)

<p><hr><p>
<a name=strings>
<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>

<i>Strings</i> are quoted sets of characters: "This is a string", "So is
this", etc. Note that we use double quotes, not single quotes --
single quotes mean something else to Lisp that we'll get to in a
moment, and just like lists (and exprs) the quotes have to balance!

<pre>
  "This is a string"

  "So is this"

  "this isn't a string because there's no end quote

  this isn't a string because there's no start quote"

  'this isn't a string because we used the wrong kind of quote'
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=syms>
<h2>Symbols</h2>

<p>

<i>Symbols</i> are a sort of like strings, except that they don't have
double quotes, and they aren't just a set of characters; rather, they
are used to symbolize something else (which is why they are called
symbols). Generally, symbols are used to store stuff, and the names of
functions are symbols.  Any name without special characters in it can
be a symbol. Here are some okay symbols:

<p>
<pre>
  symbol
  a-symbol
  this-is-a-symbol
  the-4th-symbol
</pre>
<p>

Here are some invalid symbols:

<p>
<pre>
  This has blanks in it
  (This has blanks, and other bad stuff)!
  12345.6789       <- This one's really a number, not a symbol!
  "This is a string, not a symbol!"   <- I'll bet you can tell what this really is!

  (this 1 is "a proper list containing" (numbers like 3.141) (symbols 
        like these) and ("some Strings" "like these"))
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=listfns>
<h2>More List Functions</h2>

<p>

The last one above is a <i>list</i>.  Lists are like exprs, but since
they are data, not to be evaluated, you don't have to worry about the
(function arg arg arg ...)  syntax. You can make lists of any of
these, or of any combination.  Here's a complex list:

<p>
<pre>
  (this list (combines 3.141 and ("This string" with) 
    (another 2.718 (numbers))))
</pre>
<p>

Now, as you might well imagine, there are a number of Lisp functions
that deal with lists instead of just doing math.  The most important
among these are: FIRST, REST, NTH, LIST, and CONS.  Let's look at a
couple of examples of these in action.  You'll see a new piece of
syntax (the single quote) that I'll explain in a minute:

<p>
<pre>
>> (first '(this (is a) list of symbols))
:: THIS

>> (rest '(this (is a) list of symbols))
:: ((IS A) LIST OF SYMBOLS)

>> (elt '(this (is a) list of symbols) 0)
:: THIS

>> (elt '(this (is a) list of symbols) 1)
:: (IS A)

>> (elt '(this (is a) list of symbols) 4)
:: SYMBOLS

</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=quote>
<h2>Quote Blocks Evaluation</h2>

</p>

Notice that in the fourth example the second element (that is, the ELT
1 element, since ELT starts at zero!) is actually a <i>list</i>, so
when we do ELT 1 (that is, get the second element) we get <i>a whole
list</i> instead of just one word!  Aside from that, it's probably
pretty obvious from those examples what these function do.  However,
as promised, there's new syntax: The single quote (') that appears
before each of the data lists in the above examples.

<p>

<font color=green>
This is a very important thing about Lisp: <i>Quote blocks evaluation</i>.
</font>

<p>

What's that mean?  Well, recall our old example: 

<pre>
>>  (* (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4))
</pre>

We did the complex "recursive evaluation" above by going into each of
the arguments of *, and evaluating them, and then using the results of
those sub-evaluations to finish the evaluation of the multiplication.
But what if we don't want Lisp to do that sub-evaluation at all; what
if we have a list that we want treated as a data list instead of as an
expr?  That's single-quote's job: It tells Lisp: Just use this list as
a list, not as an expr; don't evaluate it, just give it up! (When
lispers say "quote" they <i>always</i> mean "single quote" -- the
things around strings are always called "double quotes". It's not our
fault that English gave these both the same name!)

<p>

Watch:

<p>
<pre>
>> (+ 3 4)
:: 7

>> '(+ 3 4)
:: (+ 3 4)

>> (first '(+ 3 4))
:: +

>> (first (+ 3 4))
:: Error: Attempt to take the car of 7 which is not listp.
</pre>
<p>

Aha!  So in the last case we forgot the quote (well, actually, of
course, I left it out on purpose for the benefit of your education!
:-), and Lisp evaluated (+ 3 4), giving 7, and then tried to get the
first element in the number 7, but FIRST only applies to lists; It
doesn't make sense to get the first element out of a number, and Lisp
is perfectly happy to tell us so!

<p>

Now, there are two functions that I mentioned above that I haven't
explained yet: LIST and CONS.  Whereas FIRST, REST, and ELT extract
the parts of a list, LIST and CONS build lists!  Watch:

<p>
<pre>
>> (list 3.141 2.783)
:: (3.141 2.783)

>> (list 'this 'and 'that)
:: (THIS AND THAT)

>> (list 'this '(and that))
:: (THIS (AND THAT))

>> (cons 'this '(and that))
:: (THIS AND THAT)
</pre>
<p>

Look carefully at the last two examples.  Notice that whereas LIST
puts things together in a new list, CONS (which is short for
"construct") jams one thing into the front of another, already
existing list.  This is a subtle but important distinction, and if you
think about it, you'll see why you need two different functions to
make lists, both LIST and CONS; There's no way to make (THIS AND THAT)
from: THIS and (AND THAT) unless you have CONS. 

<p>

While you're looking at the above example, notice the use of quotes to
block evaluation in some places, and not in others.  We don't need to
block evaluation of numbers, because Lisp understands that the value
of a number is just the number itself.  But we did have to block it
for 'THIS and '(AND THAT). Why?  What happens if you try evaluating
(AND THAT), that is, leaving out the quote?  Remember (function arg
arg arg...) and recursive evaluation: It'll think that AND is a
function -- which, as it turns out, it is!  (It's a function that
combines a bunch of trues and falses together). So just like our
previous examples, it's going to look at its arguments and compute
their values, then do its things.  But THAT doesn't have any value, so
you'll get an error.  Watch:

<pre>
>> (cons 'this (and that))
:: <<< Evaluation failed. Actual error: >>>
   <<< Attempt to take the value of the unbound variable `THAT'.>>>
</pre>

Okay, so it was okay with AND, but THAT is unbound. We'll see in a
moment what "unbound" means.  Now compare that error with this one:

<pre>
>> (cons 'this (will create a different error))  
:: ; While compiling (:ANONYMOUS-LAMBDA 494):
   Warning: While compiling these undefined functions were referenced:
       WILL.
   > <<< Evaluation failed. Actual error: >>>
   <<< Attempt to take the value of the unbound variable `CREATE'.>>>
</pre>

That happened because whereas AND <i>is</i> a lisp function, WILL
<i>is not</i> a lisp function, so the recursive evaluator tries to do the
function WILL and gets immediately confused, and yells at you, but it
pushes on anyway (for an obscure reason), and, again hits the unbound
symbol CREATE.

<p><hr><p>
<a name=dwim>
<h2>Do What I Meant! (DWIM)</h2>

<p>

Here's yet another example of a slightly different sort of error:

<pre>
>> (cons 'this (will cause a "DWIM" correction))
:: ; While compiling (:ANONYMOUS-LAMBDA 509):
   Warning: While compiling these undefined functions were referenced:
       WILL.
   > <<< Unbound variable: CAUSE >>>
   Maybe you meant one of these?  CASE   [f]   [show modified form]   [execute modified form] 
</pre>

Notice that this time, even though it didn't understand CAUSE, it
thought that maybe you just made a slight typo, and mean CASE instead
-- <i>You didn't, so don't select either of the offered correction options!</i>

<p>

This is called "DWIMing" -- DWIM stands for "Do What I Meant"; it's a
sort of spelling checker and corrector, but it lets you tell it when
you want the correction made. Here's a good example of DWIMing (and
we'll learn a new function while we're at it):

<pre>
>> (appned '(this list) '(that list))
   Warning: While compiling these undefined functions were referenced:
         APPNED.
   > <<< Unbound function: APPNED >>>
   Maybe you meant one of these?  APPEND   [f]   [show modified form]   [execute modified form] 
</pre>

This time we really <i>did</i> mean APPEND, so click on: [show
modified form], and you should see: (append '(this list) '(that list))
in the EVAL window (the big one), which you can execute by pressing on
the [EVAL] button, and get the right answer:

<pre>
:: (THIS LIST THAT LIST)
</pre>

Notice that APPEND puts two lists together end-to-end. 

<p>

Here's a challenge: What single expression, using just LIST, CONS,
FIRST, REST, and APPEND will do this:

<pre>
  Input:  '(grateful are those who are not dead)
  Output: (grateful dead)
</pre>

Here's another, harder one:

<pre>
  Input:  '(I think that (I shall never see) (a list (as lovely (as a tree))))
  Output: ((I shall never see) (a tree) (as lovely (as a list)))
</pre>

(Answers at the end!)

<p><hr><p>
<a name=trees>
<h2>Lists as Trees</h2>

<p>

Speaking of trees, deeply embedded lists, like the ones in this last
problem, represent trees of a certain sort, again by the ubiquitous
recursive reading that we used to do recusive evaluation above. So,
for example, this complex list:

<pre>
  (I think that (I shall never see) (a list (as lovely (as a tree))))
</pre>

Represents this tree:

<pre>
     /\
    I /\
     /  \
  think /\
       /  \
     that /\
         /  \
        /\   \                           
       I /\   \                          
        /  \   \                         
     shall /\   \                        
          /  \   \                       
       never /\   \                      
            /  \   \                     
          see  nil  \                    
                     \
                     /\          
                    /\ nil          
                   a /\          
                    /  \          
                  list /\          
                      /\ nil          
                    as /\          
                      /  \          
                  lovely  \          
                          /\          
			 /\ nil
                        as \          
                           /\          
                          a /\               
                           /  \                    
                         tree nil                   
</pre>

Whoa! Hmmm. Well, let's look carefully at this: Note, first, that all
the words are on the lefthand branches, and all the righthand branches
eventually end in nil. Nil is the empty list, sometimes written:
(). This tree notation, which is really clunky to write down (which is
why we use lists!) is actually really really really important, so it's
worth understanding! Let's look at a slightly simpler case:

<pre>
  (a s d f)

Has this tree:


   /\
  a /\
   s /\
    d /\
     f nil
</pre>

Given this, you can understand what the lisp functions FIRST and REST
do quite easily: First goes down the left branch, and REST goes down
the right branch of the tree. Given that, I'll bet that you can
predict what this does:

<pre>
>> (first '(a s d f))
:: a
>> (rest '(a s d f))
:: (s d f)
>> (first (rest '(a s d f)))
:: s
...etc...
>> (rest (rest (rest (rest '(a s d f)))))
:: nil
</pre>

As predicted, if we walk along all the righthand branches, you find a
nil there. (You can keep trying to walk into the nil, but it doesn't
go anywhere, (rest nil) is just nil!)

<p>

So let's go back up to the complex list above: (I think that (I shall
never see) (a list (as lovely (as a tree)))), and it's big complex
tree (which we won't reprint, you can just scroll up to it!) How can
we get the subtree: (I shall never see)?

<pre>
>> (first (rest (rest (rest '(I think that (I shall never see) (a list (as lovely (as a tree))))))))
:: (I shall never see)
</pre>

Cool! Once you understand this, it turns out that we'll give you a
simpler way to think about more-or-less the same thing. Let's take the
simple case again: (a s d f).  A simpler tree that means pretty much
the same thing (but is harder to draw in ASCII art!) is this one:

<pre>
          _ * _    <- All 4 branches meet here!
         / / \ \      (It's just hard to draw that in ASCII!)
        / |   | \
       /  |   |  \
      /   |   |   \
     a    s   d    f
</pre>

What I'm trying to draw here is just a list of four elements, where
each letter is one the the elements or "sublists". This representation
is simpler to think about with ELT instead of the series of FIRST and
REST functions, so, again returning to the complex list above, the
sublist (i shall never see) is also just (elt ... 3) of the complex
list (remember, elt starts at 0):

<pre>
>> (elt '(I think that (I shall never see) (a list (as lovely (as a tree)))) 3)
:: (I shall never see)
</pre>

Given all this, can you guess what the function CONS does in terms of
trees? (Hint 1: It's simpler to think of it in the binary tree form,
with all the nils. Hint 2: Remember that CONS stands for!)

<a name=binding>
<h2>Symbols and Value "Bindings"</h2>

<p>

I promised to tell you what "unbound" means. It means you never gave
the symbol a value (that is, you never "bound" a value to it). Symbols
can have "bindings" that is, values.  Here's an example to give you
the idea:

<pre>>
>> (+ 34 56)
:: 90

>> first-number
:: Attempt to take the value of the unbound variable `FIRST-NUMBER'.

>> (setf first-number 34)
:: 34

>> first-number
:: 34

>> (+ first-number 56)
:: 90
</pre>

So, you see, we've "bound" the symbol FIRST-NUMBER to the value 34
(using the special Lisp instruction SETF -- you can read (setf
first-number 34) as 'assign (or bind) the value 34 to the symbol
FIRST-NUMBER'), and then used it in the addition calculation.  We
didn't use a quote before FIRST-NUMBER in the last expression because
we <i>wanted</i> it to be evaluated.  Here's what happens if we make
the opposite mistake:

<pre>
>> (+ 'first-number 56)
:: `FIRST-NUMBER' is not of the expected type `NUMBER'
</pre>

See, FIRST-NUMBER isn't a number, it's a symbol, but its <i>value
</i> is a number! 
<p>

<font color=green>
The key concept here is that symbols can be used in two ways -- as
data objects themselves, in which case we quote them, or for the
values they contain, in which case we don't.
</font>

<pre>
;; Use a symbol as a data object:
>> (list 'first-number 'first-number)
:: (first-number first-number)

;; Use a symbol for its value:
>> (+ first-number first-number)
:: 68
  
;; Use a symbol to confuse the heck out of you:
>> (list 'first-number first-number)
::  (first-number 34)
</pre>

This may be confusing right now.  That might be because in computer
languages you are used to, you can't use a symbol as a data object,
you can only use it for its value.  Don't worry, you'll get used to
it!

<p>

Here are some more examples:

<pre>
>> (setf poem '(I think that (I shall never see) (a list (as lovely (as a tree)))))

>> (first (rest (rest (rest poem))))
:: (I shall never see)

>> (elt poem 3)
:: (I shall never see)

>> (setf simple-list '(a s d f))

>> (rest simple-list)
:: (s d f)

>> (reverse simple-list)
:: (f d s a)

>> (reverse poem)
:: ((a list (as lovely (as a tree))) (I shall never see) that think I)
</pre>

(Why didn't REVERSE turn the whole poem around? Because REVERSE only
works on the top level of the tree!)

<p>

Okay, let's put it all together!  Try to figure out what these
combined exprs evaluate to before doing them:

<p>
<pre>

>> (list (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4))

>>  (* (+ (first '(1 2 3 4 5)) (first (rest '(1 2 3 4 5))))
>>     (+ (elt '(1 2 3 4 5) 2) (elt '(1 2 3 4 5) 3)))
</pre>

Okay, so here we go:

<pre>
>> (setf saying '(grateful are those who are not dead))

>>  (list (elt saying (+ (* (+ 2 3) (* (+ 3 4 2 (- 1 3 (+ 3 4)))))))
>>        (elt saying (* 2 (+ 1 2))))

    [Hint: You can get the value of the complex math expr in this 
           last one from a previous example, above!]

</pre>
</p>

Great! So you're now ready either to move on to some more complex
BioBike, or maybe just to lie down for a while until your headache
goes away!

<a name=exer>
<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p><hr></p>

1. Create an arithmetic expression using only the numbers 1 through
9 each EXACTLY ONCE, and the operators +, -, *, and EXPT (you can use
these as many times as you like) to create an expression that
evaluates to exactly 2006. [EXPT raises one number to the power of
another number, so, for example: (expt 10 2) => 100.]

<p>

[Hint: Build the complete expression in the EVAL box (the larger one),
and try out parts of it as you work in the ENTER box (the smaller
one).]

<p><hr></p>

2. Each of the following has an error in it. Fix the error. (X => Y
means "X evaluates to Y") Hint: Copy the lefthand expression into the
enter box and try it out. (Sometimes this will help, sometimes the
error is less obvious.)

<pre>
Example:

  (+ 3 4) => 8
  Corrected: (+ 3 4) => 7
or:
  Corrected: (+ 3 5) => 8

Your turn:

  (+ 3 4  => 7
  3+4 => 7
  "this is a string
  this is a symbol
  "this is a symbol"
  this-is-a-string
  (list 1 2 3) => (3 2 1)
  (list (list 1 2 3)) => 1 2 3
  (list (list 1 2 3)) => (1 2 3)
  (list (1 2 3)) => ((1 2 3))
  (list list 1 2 3) => 1 2 3
  (cons 3.141 (1 2 3)) => (3.141 1 2 3)
  (cons a-symbol '(some more symbols)) => (a-symbol some more symbols)
  (append (this list) (that list)) => ((this list) that list)
  (append '(this list) '(that list)) => ((this list) that list)

</pre>

<p><hr></p>

3. Using only the functions: FIRST, REST, CONS, APPEND, LIST,
REVERSE and ELT and each input, create each output. You can
say (setf in ...) and then use it (as, for example in the first
example). [Note: No quoted symbols or lists allowed, so it's not possible to
cheat by just entering the result!]

<pre>
Example:

  In:  (setf in '(grateful are those who are not dead))
  Out: (grateful dead)
  Method: (list (first in) (first (reverse in)))

Your turn:

  In:  '(the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain)
  Out: (in spain the rain on falls the plain mainly)

  In:  '((the rain) (in spain) (falls mainly) (on the plain))
  Out: ((in spain) (the rain) (falls on) (the plain) mainly)

  In:  '(the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain)
  Out: (plain the on mainly falls spain in rain the)
  Hint: This is easier than it looks.

  In:  '((the rain) (in spain) (falls mainly) (on the plain))
  Out: ((on the plain) (falls mainly) (in spain) (the rain))
  Hint: This is MUCH easier than it looks!

  In:  '((((((((the (((rain)))) (in spain))))))) (((((falls mainly) ((((on the plain)))))))))
  Out: ((((((falls mainly) ((((on the plain)))))))) (((((((the (((rain)))) (in spain))))))))
  Hint: This one is INCREDIBLY easy (given how complex it looks)!!

  In:  '((((the ((rain))) (in spain))) (((falls (mainly)) (on ((the) plain)))))
  Out: ((mainly ((on the) plain) falls (the (rain in))) spain)
  Hint: Oops... Well, so much for easy problems!
