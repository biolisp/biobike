Lots of things you'll do with BioLingua involve looping -- otherwise
known as <i>"iteration"</i>.  For instance, you might want to execute some
code for each organism in the current database, or for each gene in an
organism. Or perhaps you want to do something over all organisms, over
all Contiguous Sequences in that organism, over every other gene in
that Contiguous sequence, etc

<p>

<b>Lisp has a multitude of ways to express iteration.  Here we'll show
you simple examples of a few different mechanisms, then concentrate on
Lisp's LOOP facility, which is a very powerful, usually readable (if
occasionally obscure), iteration tool.  Then we'll demonstrate how we
use LOOP and other iteration constructs to search for relevant frames.</b>

<pre>
>> (loop for j from 0 to 10 sum j)
</pre>

<pre>
>> (let ((sum 0))
>>   (dotimes (j 11 sum) (incf sum j)))
</pre>
