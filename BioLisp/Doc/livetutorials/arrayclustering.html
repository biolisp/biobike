<p>

In order to work with microarray data, we first have to get the data
into the BioBike server, and then into the listener.  This is
actually the hardest part of microarray analysis, because there are
many different ways in which a table of data might be interpreted.

<p>

Let's take it step by step:

<p>

Let's first get the data that's going to be used in this example. I've
conveniently put it on this server <a
href=livetutorial-files/arrayclustering/hihara.tbl>here</a>.  Download
the data to some convenient place on your computer. If you open this
file with, say, WordPad or some other editor, you'll see that it's
just a table of microarray ratios over four time points, indexed (on
the left) by gene names from Synechocystis (slr1234, etc.)  The top
line is a header line, and tells us, in this case, that the time
points are at 30, 60, 360, and 900 minutes.

<p>

(Note that if you just download the file using Internet Explorer, and
leave the file type selection as "text file", it'll actually call the
file "hihara.tbl.txt". You can either set the file type to "all
files", or rename the file once you've downloaded it, or use
"hihara.tbl.txt", in all of the following; Your choice!)

<p>

Now we want to get this table into the BioBike server so that we can
work with it.  To do this, click on the "UPLOAD" button below the
expression entry box.  You can either type in the file that you saved
(probably C:\temp\hihara.tbl), or browse for it, and then give it a
name on the server.  How about calling it "hihara.tbl" (don't type the
double-quotes!)  This will upload the data to the server in the
indicated file. 

<p>

Next we have to get the table into BioBike.  There's a table reading
primitive built in.  Cut-and-paste this expression into the expression
entry box, and evaluate it:

<pre>
>> (simple-read-table "hihara.tbl")
:: 
(("geneID " 15 60 360 900)
 ("s6803.ssr3571" 0.97 1.05 0.96 0.92)
 ("s6803.ssr3570" 0.99 1.11 0.91 0.96)
 ("s6803.ssr3532" 1.46 1.15 1.21 0.88)
 ("s6803.ssr3467" 1.08 1.51 0.98 0.84)
 ("s6803.ssr3465" 0.51 0.76 1.16 0.7)
 ...

</pre>

Let's assign this to a variable for future reference:

<pre>
>> (setq mytable *)  ; Recall that * refers to the last result!
</pre>

Now we are ready to try some analysis.  Let's start with simple
things, like clustering.  BioBike uses the R statistical package,
which has a lot of microarray statistical tools.  For now we're just
going to use a simple clustering package from R, called "cclust" which
does k-means clustering of tabular data. With k-means clustering, you
have to give the clustering program the number of groups you want to
find.  We'll use 5 just for example here, but usually you'd want this
to reflect your theoretical position somehow.

<p>

To do the clustering, you use this command:

<pre>
     (r-cluster-kmeans data n-clusters iterations :verbose? t)
</pre>

For example:

<p>
<pre>
>> (setq cluster-results (r-cluster-kmeans mytable 5 20 :verbose? t))
</pre>
<p>

The number of iterations (20, in this case) tells the clustering
package how many tries to attempt to refine the clustering before
giving up and deciding that the clusters are fine as is.  (You'd have
to read up on clustering to understand what this means; for now, just
take our word for it that this value is reasonable.)

<p>

r-cluster-kmeans returns a frame (called something like #$Temp123)
that contains the cluster centers and a vector that assigns each gene
in the table to a particular cluster.  Because of the setq above,
we've already captured that frame in the variable CLUSTER-RESULTS.
This frame has a number of slots that enable us to use the result
of clustering in later analysis, and we're about to do just that!

<p>

First let's look at the cluster centers.  You can just do:

<pre>
>> (#^centers cluster-results)
</pre>

And you'll get something like this:

<pre>
  :: #2A((8.336956 2.6795652 1.7404348 1.3195652)
         (1.2564787 1.5049518 1.5292985 1.2145942)
         (1.0566963 1.0633571 1.049478 0.963274)
         (0.62611 0.6859725 0.7238114 0.7328094)
         (2.2658956 2.4494777 2.0722387 1.7027612))
</pre>

Those are the centers okay, but really what we want to do is find out
what these clusters represent in conceptual terms -- that is, for
example, in terms of concepts in the Gene Ontology. There are a few
functions which help you do to this that we've already written, and you
can also easily invent more on your own.

<p>

Here's one that we've written:

<p>
<pre>
>> (display-clusters cluster-results)
</pre>
<p>

This tells you what the cluster centers are (as above), and the number
of genes in each cluster, but also determines how many of the genes in
the data have representatives in the Gene Ontology.

<p>

The output will look something like this:

<p>
<pre>
;; Displaying cluster means: 
;; Cluster 1, Center: #(1.987027 2.3041081 2.0377297
                        1.6457838), Members: 185
;; Cluster 2, Center: #(0.9667406 0.9612508 0.9465003
                        0.8881947), Members: 1623
;; Cluster 3, Center: #(1.2127599 1.3634677 1.3790501
                        1.1384408), Members: 1116
;; Cluster 4, Center: #(8.0804 2.6592 1.7644 1.3784), Members: 25
;; Cluster 5, Center: #(0.13115385 0.39584616 0.5466923
                        0.67415386), Members: 130
</pre>

In other words Cluster 3, for example, has 1116 genes in it.  Although
this is vaguely interesting, we'd like to get a lot more detailed
about what's really represented among these clusters.

<p>

<p>

Now, suppose that we wanted to actually get the genes that are in a
particular cluster.  This takes a very small amount of extra work:

<pre>
>> (genes-in-cluster mytable (#^membership cluster-results) 1)
:: ("s6803.ssl3044" "s6803.slr2075" "s6803.slr1963" "s6803.slr1675" "s6803.slr1641" "s6803.slr1544" "s6803.slr1512"
    "s6803.slr1291" "s6803.sll1884" "s6803.sll1733" "s6803.sll1732" "s6803.sll1514" "s6803.sll1483" "s6803.sll1032"
    "s6803.sll1028" "s6803.sll0846" "s6803.sll0528" "s6803.sll0430" "s6803.sll0219" "s6803.sll0218" "s6803.sll0217"
    "s6803.sll0170" "s6803.sll0005")
</pre>

Let's setq those into a convenient variable:

<pre>
>> (setq c1genes *)
</pre>

Now, at the moment these are just the NAMES of the genes.  In order to
make these actual gene frames we have to load up the information for
that organism:

<pre>
>> (load-organism :syn6803)
</pre>

Then there's a convenient function that turns everything that's the name of
a frame, into the frame itself:

<pre>
>> (help ->frames)

  Translates all of the strings in any sort of complex list structure 
  into the frames names by those strings.  Returns a new structure 
  exactly like the given one, where the strings are translated into 
  frames wherever possible.  If CREATE is true, strings which do not 
  currently name frames have frames created with that name. 
</pre>

So all we have to do is:

<p>
<pre>
>> (->frames c1genes)

    #$s6803.slr1860 #$s6803.slr1859 ...)
  
And Bob's your Uncle!
</pre>

Sine that looks right, let's replace it into c1genes:

<p>
<pre>
>> (setq c1genes *)
</pre>

Okay, so now we can analyze these in a slightly more interesting
way. Each gene frame has information about the Gene Ontology (GO)
categories that are related to the gene. For example:

<pre>
>> (#^Go-Id #$S6803.slr2026)
::(#$GO.TransferaseActivity #$GO.FolicAcidAndDerivativeMetabolism
   #$GO.ResponseToAntibiotic #$GO.DihydropteroateSynthaseActivity
   #$GO.FolicAcidAndDerivativeBiosynthesis)
</pre>

This indicates that this gene is related to these functions. Notice
that these functions are related to one another, but describe the
function at various levels of specificity.

<p>

So all that we need to do is to group the genes into categories by
their GO identities. It turns out the BioBike has a function called
CATEGORIZE that does just that!

<pre>
>> (help categorize)

     Given a list of object, and a function that applies to those objects and returns
     a single category or list of categories re-organize the objects by the cateogies.
     This uses EQUAL hash tables, so the function must return something that can be EQUAL tested.
     Example: (categorize '(1 2 3 4 5) #'evenp) => ((NIL 5 3 1) (T 4 2))
     [The order of the result categorize and objects in each is indeterminate.]
     More complex example:
     (categorize '("Jeff" "Joe" "Sam" "Sall") #'(lambda (object) (list (elt object 0) (length object))))
     ((3 "Sam" "Joe") (4 "Sall" "Jeff") (#J "Joe" "Jeff") (#S "Sall" "Sam"))
     Note that we get BOTH categories in this case by first letter AND by length.
</pre>

So we should be able to just pass CATEGORIZE the list of gene frames and the #^go-id function:

<pre>
>> (setf cats1 (categorize c1genes #^go-id))
::
((#$GO.GlycerateKinaseActivity #$S6803.slr1840)
 (#$GO.ProteinAminoAcidPhosphorylation #$S6803.slr1840)
 (#$GO.PhospholipidBiosynthesis #$S6803.slr1755)
 (#$GO.Glycerol-3-PhosphateDehydrogenase[Nad+]Activity #$S6803.slr1755)
 (#$GO.Glycerol-3-PhosphateDehydrogenaseComplex #$S6803.slr1755)
 (#$GO.Glycerol-3-PhosphateMetabolism #$S6803.slr1755)
 (#$GO.N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-AlanineAmidaseActivity #$S6803.slr1744)
 (#$GO.PeptidoglycanCatabolism #$S6803.slr0795 #$S6803.slr1744)
 (#$GO.TranscriptionFactorActivity #$S6803.sll0567 #$S6803.sll0594
  #$S6803.sll0794 #$S6803.sll1286 #$S6803.sll1423 #$S6803.sll1924
  #$S6803.slr0395 #$S6803.slr1738)
 (#$GO.InnerMembrane #$S6803.sll0683 #$S6803.sll0684 #$S6803.slr0677
  #$S6803.slr0678 #$S6803.slr1453 #$S6803.slr1455 #$S6803.slr1471
  #$S6803.slr1728)
 ...
</pre>

Cool! We can sort those by length to find the most representative categories:

<pre>
>> (sort cats1 #'> :key #'length)
</pre>

Confirm that the result seems to be sorted so that the largest categories come first.

<p>

So let's put it all together into a function that does the steps we
just did on one of the clusters:

<pre>
 (defun analyze-cluster (data-table cluster-results cluster-number how-many-go-ids-to-return)
   (loop for (go-id) in (sort
                          (categorize 
                           (->frames
                            (genes-in-cluster data-table (#^membership cluster-results) cluster-number))
                           #^go-id)
                          #'> :key #'length)
         as n below how-many-go-ids-to-return
         collect go-id))
</pre>

Let's try it:

<pre>
>> (analyze-cluster mytable cluster-results 4 5)
<178>> (analyze-cluster mytable cluster-results 4 5)
:: 
<<< Evaluation failed. Actual error: >>>
<<< You are trying to use SLOTV to access or set "s6803.ssr2786", but
    that
function can only be used with frames.  You called it with
    "s6803.ssr2786",
which is of type (SIMPLE-ARRAY CHARACTER (13)).
<<< Use (EXPLAIN) to see a stack trace. >>>
</pre>

Oops... Seems like some of the genes don't have frames (so ->FRAMES
didn't convert them). Hmmm. Let's put in a filter for that:

<pre>
 (defun analyze-cluster (data-table cluster-results cluster-number how-many-go-ids-to-return)
   (loop for (go-id) in 
       (sort (categorize 
                 (loop for frame? in 
                           (->frames
                            (genes-in-cluster data-table (#^membership cluster-results) cluster-number))
                       if (framep frame?)
                       collect frame?)
                 #^go-id)
                 #'> :key #'length)
         as n below how-many-go-ids-to-return
         collect go-id))
</pre>

Let's try that again:

<pre>
>> (analyze-cluster mytable cluster-results 4 5)
:: (NIL #$GO.AtpBinding #$GO.Membrane #$GO.TransferaseActivity
    #$GO.CatalyticActivity)
</pre>

Cool!

<p>

Now let's try it for all the clusters:

<p>

<pre>
 (loop for cluster from 1 to 5
       do (print (analyze-cluster mytable cluster-results cluster 5)))
:: 
(NIL #$GO.AtpBinding #$GO.Membrane #$GO.TransferaseActivity
     #$GO.ProteinBiosynthesis) 
(NIL #$GO.ChaperoneActivity #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity
     #$GO.ElectronTransport #$GO.HeatShockProteinActivity) 
(NIL #$GO.ProteinBiosynthesis #$GO.StructuralConstituentOfRibosome
     #$GO.Intracellular #$GO.Ribosome) 
(NIL #$GO.AtpBinding #$GO.Membrane #$GO.TransferaseActivity
     #$GO.CatalyticActivity) 
(NIL #$GO.Photosynthesis #$GO.ElectronTransport #$GO.Membrane
     #$GO.IntegralToMembrane) 
> NIL
</pre>

(That NIL which is always there is slightly annoying, but
we can easily get rid of it, and will in a moment!)

<p>

So each cluster is conveniently described by slightly different GO
categories, grossly:

<pre>
   Cluster 1 = AtpBinding
   Cluster 2 = ChaperoneActivity
   Cluster 3 = ProteinBiosynthesis
   Cluster 4 = AtpBinding
   Cluster 5 = Photosynthesis
</pre>

Okay, so this isn't the most perfect analytical technique, but it
gives you a sense of what's going on. In other tutorials we'll look
more carefully at understanding what's going on in microarray data.

<p>

Maybe we can get a little more clever about figuring out what's
different about the various results. Conceptually, we want to figure
out what differs among a bunch of lists. So, for example, if we had:
(a s d f) (a q w s d e) and (a w d r), we see that (a d) are the same
for every list. This happens to be the intersection of these lists,
watch:

<pre>
>> (intersection '(a s d f) '(a q w s d e))
::  (D S A)
>> (intersection * '(a w d r))
:: (A D)
</pre>

It turns out that there's a magic way to "map" a function over a list
of lists pairwaise like this; it's called REDUCE:

<pre>
>> (reduce #'intersection '((a s d f) (a q w s d e) (a w d r)))
:: (A D)
</pre>

[Here's a harder, but more obvious way to do the same thing:

 (setf lists '((a s d f) (a q w s d e) (a w d r)))

 (loop with result = (first lists)
       as next in (rest lists)
       do (setf result (intersection result next))
       finally (return result))
:: (A D)
</pre>
]

<p>

Give (a d) we now have to REMOVE that subset from each member. Again,
there's a function already there to do this:

<pre>
>> (set-difference '(a q w s d e) '(a d))
:: (E S W Q)

Note that you need to do this the right way around or you'll get
nothing:

>> (set-difference '(a d) '(a q w s d e))
:: NIL
</pre>

SET-DIFFERENCE is like subtraction: subtract the second list from the first.

<p>

Okay, so now we should be able to improve our method of
reporting. Here's what we did above:

<pre>
 (loop for cluster from 1 to 5
       do (print (analyze-cluster mytable cluster-results cluster 5)))
</pre>

Here's the same thing, but this time using reduce, intersection, and
set-difference to show only the differences between the groups:

<pre>
 (let* ((clusters 
          (loop for cluster from 1 to 5
                collect (analyze-cluster mytable cluster-results cluster 50)))
        (common-elements (reduce #'intersection clusters)))
   (loop for cluster in clusters
         do (print (first-n 5 (set-difference cluster common-elements))))
</pre>

Note that we asked for the top 50 elements of the cluster at first,
and then restricted it to only the first 5 <i>after</i> we had the
set-differences.

<p>

Here's the result:

<pre>
(#$GO.ProteinFolding #$GO.MetallopeptidaseActivity #$GO.CellAdhesion
 #$GO.ProteinModification #$GO.NickelIonBinding) 
(#$GO.Glycolysis #$GO.TrnaProcessing #$GO.TranscriptionFactorActivity
 #$GO.DnaRepair #$GO.NucleaseActivity) 
(#$GO.PeptidoglycanBiosynthesis #$GO.ResponseToStress
 #$GO.InnerMembrane #$GO.NucleaseActivity #$GO.AminoAcidMetabolism) 
(#$GO.IntracellularProteinTransport #$GO.TrnaProcessing
 #$GO.Two-ComponentSensorMoleculeActivity #$GO.LigaseActivity
 #$GO.Photosystem) 
(#$GO.Glycolysis #$GO.DnaReplication
 #$GO.Peptidyl-ProlylCis-TransIsomeraseActivity
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph,QuinoneOrSimilarCompoundAsAcceptor
 #$GO.MolecularFunctionUnknown) 
</pre>

Note that this only removes elements common to ALL the lists, so, for
example, #$GO.Glycolysis is still there even though it's in two of the
lists, because it's not in ALL of them, but still, this is a more
useful list than the one above! (nd notice that we got rid of that pesky NIL!)

<p>

Okay, so now we can put it all together (and we'll get rid of those
annoying nils at the same time!):

<pre>
 (defun analyze-microarray-data (table-file k-means &key (trials 20) (how-many-go-ids-to-return 5))
  (let* ((mytable (simple-read-table table-file))
         (cluster-results (r-cluster-kmeans mytable k-means trials :verbose? t))
         (clusters 
           (loop for cluster from 1 to k-means
                 collect (analyze-cluster mytable cluster-results cluster 50)))
         (common-elements (reduce #'intersection clusters)))
    (loop for cluster in clusters
         do (print (first-n how-many-go-ids-to-return (set-difference cluster common-elements))))
    ))
</pre>

And we try it:

<pre>
>> (analyze-microarray-data "hihara.tbl" 5)

</pre>

Cool! Experiment with other values of the arguments, esp. the k-means
one, which tells how many clusters to make!
