<h2>Introduction: What is a function?</h2>

This lesson discusses the concept of "functions" in Lisp. This is
probably the hardest, and most important lesson in the whole
series. If you study it carefully, and understand it, you will be on
the path toward true enlightenment (at least as far as programming
goes....)

<p>

So, what <i>is</i> a function?

<p>

A function is just a little piece of code that does a little thing.

<p>

The plus sign (+) is a function that adds things together and returns the result:

<pre>
>> (+ 3 4)
:: 7
</pre>

Of course, you can create your own functions too:

<pre>
>> (defun pi-times (n) (* n 3.14159))
:: PI-TIMES
>> (pi-times 2.71828)
:: 8.5397215
</pre>

<i>Okay, that wasn't so hard! Is that all there is to enlightenment?</i>

<p>

Well, pretty close, actually, but it's really a way of thinking that
we're talking about, not just what you do, precisely.

<p>

<a name=firstclass>
<h2>Functions are First Class!</h2>

Functions in Lisp have a sort of life of their own. In computer
jargon, they are called "first class objects", which means that in
addition to using them, like we did just above when we used the +
function, or creating new ones like pi-times, you can
<i>manipulate</i> functions -- pass them around, apply them to things
under program control, and even create new functions in the middle of
running programs!

<p>

<i>Huh?</i>

<p>

Okay, let's start with something simple. Suppose that you had a whole
series of numbers that you wanted to do the same thing to each one.
Here are some numbers:

<pre>
>> (setf my-numbers '(1 3 5 7 9))
</pre>

Now, suppose that you wanted to do pi-times to each one of them.  One
way to do it would be to write a loop and call pi-times over and over,
like this:

<pre>
>> (loop for n in my-numbers
>>       collect (pi-times n))
:: (3.14159 9.42477 15.707951 21.99113 28.274311)

</pre>

Or, you could write a recursive function that did the same thing (sort
of like the factorial function from another lesson, only it collects
up the results):

<pre>
>> (defun pi-times-all (list)
>>    (cond ((null list) nil)
>>          (t (cons (pi-times (first list))
>>                (pi-times-all (rest list))))))

>> (pi-times-all my-numbers)
:: (3.14159 9.42477 15.707951 21.99113 28.274311)
</pre>

The point is that you want to take some function, in this case pi-times
and apply it over and over to every number in my-list.

<p>

Lisp has a special function for applying the same function to every
element in a list (and returning a list of the results, which is what
we're after). Let's see it in action first, and then examine how we
use it:

<pre>
>> (mapcar #'pi-times my-numbers)
:: (3.14159 9.42477 15.707951 21.99113 28.274311)
</pre>

All that mapcar does is the exact same thing that either the
collecting loop or the recursive function did above, but notice that
there's a weird new piece of syntax: #' (called "pound quote"). #' is
a function constructor -- it takes whatever is after it, and gets the
function associated with it. If you do #'pi-times separately, you'll
get this weird-looking thing:

<pre>
>> #'pi-times
:: #&lt;Function PI-TIMES&gt;
</pre>

Now, let's think about what that MAPCAR did up there, because if you
think about a little, it did something pretty amazing -- we gave it an
arbitrary function (pi-times, in this case), and it applied that
function to every element in the list. Think about that for a
moment.... <i>A function that takes a function and applies it.</i>

<p>

<i>So, you mean, we could have given mapcar <b>any</b> function?</i>

<p>

That's right -- any function that expects just one argument. Let's try
some others:

<pre>
>> (mapcar #'- my-numbers)
:: (-1 -3 -5 -7 -9)

>> (mapcar #'sqrt my-numbers)
:: (1.0 1.7320508 2.236068 2.6457512 3.0)

>> (mapcar #'list my-numbers)
:: ((1) (3) (5) (7) (9))

>> (mapcar #'oddp my-numbers)
:: (T T T T T)

;;; [ODDP returns true (T) if the number it's given is odd.]

</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=metafunctions>
<h2>Meta-Functions do things with other functions!</h2>


So, mapcar is a sort of "<i>meta</i>-function" -- it's a function that takes
another function, applies it to every element in a list, and returns a
new list of the results of the applications.

<p>

Now, maybe that doesn't seem too weird to you, in which case either
you're not paying attention, or you may already have reached The Zen
of Lisp -- true enlightenment.... (I'm guessing the former! :-) 

<p>

So, let's look at some other meta-functions:

<p>

Another common meta-function is SORT. Sort takes a list, and ... well,
sorts them. (Duh!) Sort needs to know <i>how</i> to sort them --
low-to-high, or high-to-low, so one of its arguments is the
<i>function</i> that compares two numbers, and tells sort which way to
arrange them.

<p>

Watch (and notice the #' use!):

<pre>
>> (sort '(1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6) #'>)
:: (6 5 4 4 3 3 2 1)

>> (sort '(1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6) #'<)
:: (1 2 3 3 4 4 5 6)

;;; Here's a good one:

>> (sort '("jeff" "sue" "dave" "andy" "walt") #'string> )
:: ("walt" "sue" "jeff" "dave" "andy")

>> (sort '("jeff" "sue" "dave" "andy" "walt") #'string< )
:: ("andy" "dave" "jeff" "sue" "walt")

</pre>

You probably don't really see why we need this; can't sort just figure
out that what it's sorting is a set of numbers, and use > or <, or
that it's sorting a set of strings and use string> or string< ....
couldn't sort just "do the right thing"? Why couldn't we just have a
sort-up and a sort-down that just "do the right thing"?

<p>

Yes, we (or, rather, the designers of Lisp) could very easily have
done that, but let's take a slightly more complex case. Suppose that
we have a set of genes... Let's get a small set just to play with:

<pre>
>> (setf genes (first-n 5 (#^genes s6803)))
:: (#$S6803.slr0612 #$S6803.slr0613 #$S6803.sll0558 #$S6803.sll1214
    #$S6803.sll1213)
</pre>

If you examine these, you'll see that they have many properties, like
a "From" and "To" property that indicates where they are in the
genome, and a property that tells us how many transmembrane spans
there are, and many other properties. Also, there are all kinds of
functions that you can apply to genes, for example to get their
sequence:

<pre>
>> (extract-sequence (first genes))
:: "TTGATTGCGTTGAATAAAACTCCCCAAACCATTGTTTTTTACAAA..."
</pre>

Let's say that we wanted to sort these genes (or <i>all</i> genes) by
some weird property, like, say, the sequence length.

<p>

One way to do this might be to use mapcar to get the sequences, and
then mapcar again to get the length of the sequences, like this:

<pre>
>> (mapcar #'extract-sequence genes)
:: 
("TTGATTGCGTTGAATAAAACTCC..."
 "ATGTCCTATCTAATCGCTGTGGT..."
 "ATGTCTGATAATTTGACCGAACT..."
 "ATGGTTAATACCCTCGAAAAGCC..."
 "ATGCTTTCCCTAGAAAATCAACG...")

>> (mapcar #'length *)
:: (693 522 702 1077 939)

;;; Which, of course, is just the same as:

>> (mapcar #'length (mapcar #'extract-sequence genes))
:: (693 522 702 1077 939)
</pre>

A slightly nicer way to do that is to make a function that gets the
length of a gene sequence:

<pre>
>> (defun genelen (gene) (length (extract-sequence gene)))

And mapcar that:

>> (mapcar #'genelen genes)
:: (693 522 702 1077 939)

</pre>

(Not only is this nicer, but it's more efficient because it doesn't
have to run down the list twice!)

<p>

Then we could use this function to sort the list of genes, just like we did above:

<pre>
>> (sort * #'>)
:: (1077 939 702 693 522)
</pre>

...Hmmmm...Okay, but wait a minute... how are we going to get back to
the genes themselves -- we don't know how sort rearranged
them.... This is going to be a bit of a problem.

<p>

Think about it for a minute, and then come back....

<p>

Figured out a way to do it yet?  Maybe so, but I'll bet it's not as simple as this:

<pre>
>> (sort genes #'> :key #'genelen)
:: (#$S6803.sll1214 #$S6803.sll1213 #$S6803.sll0558 #$S6803.slr0612
    #$S6803.slr0613)

[It's right, you can check it out from the above lengths, if you like.]
</pre>

I can hear you thinking: <i>WHOA! What the hey was that?!</i>

<p>

This time we gave SORT <i>two</i> functions. The first one was the way
to sort (by #'> -- that is, so that the largest things are first). The
second function is indicated by the optional argument :KEY. :KEY tells
sort <u>what function to use on each element in the list in order to
get the value that will be used to sort</u>. That is, we told sort to
take each gene, get it's sequence length (using our function GENELEN)
and then sort the genes based upon the #'> function applied to those
values (i.e., the gene lengths).

<p>

The :KEY argument to sort is <i>very</i> useful! Let's say, for
example for some weird reason you want to alphebetize the genes by
their sequence:

<pre>
>> (sort genes #'string< :key #'extract-sequence)
:: (#$S6803.sll1213 #$S6803.sll1214 #$S6803.slr0613 #$S6803.sll0558
    #$S6803.slr0612)

[Check this yourself!]
</pre>

<a name=Lambda>
<h2>Lambda creates anonymous functions</h2>

So that's the first step along the path to Lisp Nirvana. Now let's
take the second step.

<p>

One thing that you might well ask is: Do I have to create my functions
separately, and then pass the names to mapcar and sort all the time,
like we did with pi-times and genelen? What if I just want to do a
<u>one-time-only</u> complex calculation, and apply that?

<p>

There are a number of answers to this, some simple and some
complex. (The simplest answer is: You can always do it by creating a
separate function, so if you don't get what's about to come next,
don't worry too much.)

<p>

There <i>is</i> a way to create what are called "anonymous functions"
-- that is, functions that don't have names -- that are just created
for one-time use. The way that you do this is by using a special lisp
function called <i>LAMBDA</i>. (Don't worry about <i>why</i> it's
called lambda -- that's a very long and mostly irrelevant story.) Just
like #' makes functions, lambda makes functions too, but lambda
doesn't need the name of the function -- it can just make a function
<i>in place</i>!

<p>

Let's revisit some of our examples using LAMBDA instead of having to
create functions.

<p>

Here's how you might do PI-TIMES without having to create a separate
function:

<pre>
>> (mapcar #'(lambda (n) (* 3.14159 n)) my-numbers)
:: (3.14159 9.42477 15.707951 21.99113 28.274311)

Notice the anonymous Lambda function:

   (mapcar #'(lambda (n) (* 3.14159 n)) my-numbers)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>

And here's our gene length sort, but without having to create the
genelen function:

<pre>
>> (sort genes #'> :key #'(lambda (gene) (length (extract-sequence gene))))
:: (#$S6803.sll1214 #$S6803.sll1213 #$S6803.sll0558 #$S6803.slr0612
    #$S6803.slr0613)
</pre>

"Lambda functions" (i.e., anonymous functions) look <i>exactly</i>
like normal functions, but the don't have names. They have some other
useful properties that we'll see in a moment.

<p>

(By the way, sometimes you'll see lambda without #' It turns out that
you don't need to use #' if you have lambda, but we do it as a
convention, and it makes it easier to see where the functions are in
reading through the code.)

<p>

Cool! So, see, you don't need to create a function every time you need
to do something fancy, just rev one up on the fly, using Lambda!

<p><hr><p>
<a name=myownmeta>
<h2>Writing your own meta-functions</h2>

Above we used the meta-functions MAPCAR and SORT. There are lots of
built-in meta-functions, but you can also write your own; that is,
write a function that takes another function as an argument, like
MAPCAR takes a function to map over the argument, and SORT takes a
sorting function and a key function.

<p>

<i>Why</i> (you might well ask) <i>would I want to write my <u>own</u> meta
function?!</i> 

<p>

Good question. There are lots of situations where this is extremely
useful. A common example is where you want to write a function that
operates on frames. Recall from previous lessons that the slots in
frames are accessed by accessors, like #^genes, or #^organism. These
are <i>functions</i>, which is why you can write:

<pre>
>> (#^genes s6803)
:: ...long list of genes...
</pre>

Let's say that we wanted to write a function (here just in the sense
of DEFUN'ing it) that operates on an arbitrary slot of a
frame. Suppose, for example, that selected genes based on some
calculated property, say the length, or the GC v. AT ratio, or some
such thing. We saw an example of that above when we sorted by length
(using SORT and passing in a lambda function that computed the length
of the sequence).

<p>

Basically what we want to do is:

<pre>
  (loop for gene in list-of-genes
        when (THE-GIVEN-TEST gene)
        collect gene)
</pre>

When a function is executed, we say that the function is
<i>applied</i> to its arguments. For example, when you do: (+ 1 2) and
get 3, the #'+ function is applied to a list of two arguments: 1 and 2
(or, in list form: '(1 2)). Another way to say this is that the
function #'+ is <i>called</i> with its two arguments. Unsurprisingly,
Lisp has functions that do both of these things, called APPLY and FUNCALL:

<pre>
>> (+ 1 2)
:: 3

>> (apply #'+ '(1 2))
:: 3

>> (funcall #'+ 1 2)
:: 3
</pre>

Which one you use (APPLY or FUNCALL) depends on whether you have all
the arguments, or you have a list of arguments, but generally speaking
it doesn't matter -- whichever one is convenient.  

<p>

Given this, we can translate the above code to make it a little more
specific:

<pre>
  (loop for gene in list-of-genes
        when (funcall THE-GIVEN-TEST gene)
        collect gene)
</pre>

And so here's our function:

<pre>
>> (defun get-genes (organism test)
>>   (loop for gene in (#^genes organism)
>>         when (funcall test gene)
>>         collect gene))
</pre>

Note that the argument TEST will be given either a #'... or #'(lambda
...) form, just like we did with SORT or MAPCAR, and that function
will be expected to accept just one argument, run the test, and return
T or NIL. (Recall that anything but NIL counts the same as T.)

<p>

Examples using our new function (pay careful attention to when we use
#'... when #^... (only on slot accessors!) and when we need
#'(lambda...)):

<pre>
;;; Find the genes in Synechococcus pcc. 6803 that start at a position
;;; greater than 3.5M nt into the genome.

>> (get-genes s6803 
>>      #'(lambda (gene) 
>>            (> (#^from gene) 3500000)))
:: ...a long list of genes...
;;; (Check these by inspecing the FROM slots of a few of them!)
;;; (Actually, this is a little silly because these genomes are 
;;;  circular, so position is a little arbitrary.)

;;; Create a function that computes the GC/AT content of the nt 
;;; sequence of a gene:

>> (defun gc/at (gene)
>>   (let* ((sequence (extract-sequence gene)))
>>     (/ (count #\C sequence)
>>        (1+ (count #\A sequence)))))
;;; (The 1+ protects against division by zero.)


;;; Now use it to find genes with abnormally high (much greater than 1.0)
;;; or low (much less than 1.0) gc/at content:

>> (get-genes s6803 
>>      #'(lambda (gene) 
>>            (< (gc/at gene) 0.25)))
:: ... list of genes ...

;;; Inspect these genes. See anything interesting about them?

</pre>

Notice a pattern in the above: We have a function that does a
calculation on a gene, and then we use either > or < and a value to
compare. This suggests that we can simplify our function as follows:

<pre>
>> (defun get-genes-2 (organism calcfn comparefn limit)
>>   (loop for gene in (#^genes organism)
>>         as value = (funcall calcfn gene)
>>         when (funcall comparefn value limit)
>>         collect gene))

;;; Now we can do the same thing more simply:

>> (get-genes-2 s6803 #^from #'> 3500000)

>> (get-genes-2 s6803 #'gc/at #'< 0.25)

</pre>

So, we've written our own meta-functions! Now what? Well, we'll see
meta functions used over and over throughout these lessons... At least
now you'll know what you're looking at, even if you don't ever
actually write your own.
