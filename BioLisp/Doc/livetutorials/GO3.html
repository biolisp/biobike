In a previous lesson we used the <i>relational</i> knowledge captured
in the Gene Ontology ISA and SUBCLASS slots to do some interesting
analysis of the relationships between biological functions.

<p>

Let's look once again at a gene ontology frame in BioBike:

<pre>
>> (df #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
::
Slots of #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity:
#$GO.goid: 3959
#$Source: :GO
#$GO.prettyname: "NADPH dehydrogenase activity"
#$GO.Namespace: #$Go.Molecular_Function
#$GO.definition: "Catalysis of the reaction: NADPH + H+ + acceptor = NADP+ + reduced acceptor."
#$isA:  (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
         #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
#$GO.ECRef: (#$EC.1.6.99.1)
#$GO.DBXRefs: (("EC" "1.6.99.1"))
#$Go.reactants: (#$MOL.Nadph #$MOL.H+ #$MOL.Acceptor)
#$Go.products: (#$MOL.Nadp+ #$MOL.ReducedAcceptor)
</pre>

In that previous lesson we were working with the ISA and SUBCLASS
slots of GO frames. We can say that the GO <i>represents</i> the
relationships between biological functions, and we used that
representation to reason (compute) about the relationships between
those functions. This time we're going to work with two other slots:
#$GO.REACTANTS, and #$GO.PRODUCTS. 

<p>

Recall from the lesson on metabolic simulation that we had created a
reaction structure and a molecular structure, and two global
variables: *reactions* and *molecules*, and then we wrote simple code
to simulate the metabolic chemistry for a few specific enzymes. (If you
don't remember, this, you should go back and review that lesson.) 

<p>

Now we want to do the same thing, but instead of defining our own
reactions and molecules, we're going to use the ones already built
into BioBike by virtue of the Gene Ontology.

<p>

You'll recall that after we had defined all our reactions and
molecules, we defined a "environment" consisting of a bunch of
molecules, and a goal, which told us to stop when we find a particular
molecule in the environment.  Here these will be nearly the same, but
instead of using simple names, as we did in the previous less, we'll
refer to the MOL. frames for the molecules we're interested
in. Otherwise these functions are mostly the same, although we're not
going to include the enzymes in the environment (we'll assume that all
enzymes are available for now):


<pre>
>> (defvar *env* nil)

>> (defun init-env ()
>>   (setq *env* 
>>     '(#$MOL.Atp #$MOL.Adp #$mol.gtp #$mol.gdp #$mol.phosphate
>>       #$MOL.Nad+ #$mol.fad #$MOL.Fructose #$MOL.d-Glucose)))
</pre>

We also need a way to figure out that we're done (otherwise we can
just keep running reactions forever!)  To do that we'll define a
specific goal molecule, which, when it shows up in the environment,
indicates that we're done.  For now we'll set up the goal to be malate:

<pre>
>> (defvar *goal* nil)

>> (defun init-goal ()
>>   (setq *goal* #$MOL.Malate))
</pre>

And the master init function:

<pre>
>> (defun init ()
>>   (init-env)
>>   (init-goal))
</pre>

And remember to call it:

<pre>
>> (init)
</pre>

Okay. Now we need the equivalent of the function that finds all the
reactions that could possibly take place given the current
environment. It turns out that that's pretty easy because the
molecules tell us what reactions operate on them.  For example, let's
look at:

<pre>
>> (df #$MOL.Glucose)
::
Slots of #$MOL.Glucose:
#$isA:  (#$GO.Molecule)
#$Go.reactantIn: (#$GO.1-PhenanthrolGlycosyltransferaseActivity
                  #$GO.9-PhenanthrolGlycosyltransferaseActivity
                  #$GO.PhenanthrolGlycosyltransferaseActivity)
#$Go.productIn: (#$GO.6-Phospho-Beta-GlucosidaseActivity
                 #$GO.InulosucraseActivity #$GO.LevansucraseActivity)
#$GO.KEGGFrame.s: (#$KEGG.C00293)
</pre>

So glucose reacts in those 6 (3+3) reactions, and if you look at one
of those:

<pre>
>> (df #$GO.6-Phospho-Beta-GlucosidaseActivity)
:: 
Slots of #$GO.6-Phospho-Beta-GlucosidaseActivity:
#$GO.goid: 8706
#$Source: :GO
#$GO.prettyname: "6-phospho-beta-glucosidase activity"
#$GO.Namespace: #$Go.Molecular_Function
#$GO.definition: "Catalysis of the reaction: 6-phospho-beta-D-glucoside-(1,4)-D-glucose + H2O = D-glucose 6-phosphate + glucose."
#$isA:  (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.Beta-GlucosidaseActivity)
#$GO.ECRef: (#$EC.3.2.1.86)
#$GO.DBXRefs: (("EC" "3.2.1.86"))
#$Go.reactants: (#$MOL.6-Phospho-Beta-D-Glucoside-[1,4]-D-Glucose
                 #$MOL.H2o)
#$Go.products: (#$MOL.D-Glucose6-Phosphate #$MOL.Glucose)
</pre>

you'll see that, indeed, it has #$MOL.Glucose as one of its products.

<p>

So all that we need to do is to go through all the GO frames and find
ones where either all of their reactants as in the environment. Here's
the specific test:

<pre>
>> (defun go-reaction-can-go-forward? (go-frame env)
>>   (loop for reactant in (#^go.reactants go-frame)
>>         when (not (member reactant env))
>>         do (return nil)
>>         finally (return t)))

;;; And here's the function that finds all possible reactions:

>> (defun possible-reactions (env)
>>   (loop for frame in *go-frames*
>>         when (go-reaction-can-go-forward? frame env)
>>         collect frame))

;;; And let's try it:

>> (possible-reactions *env*)
:: [...a HUGE long list of GO frames! ...]
</pre>

Oops! Obvious not ALL of those can react in the present setting.  One
thing that we neglected to check is that the GO frame actually
represents a reaction; most of the ones in the long list turn out not
to be reactions at all, but because they have no #^go.reactants slot,
they can go forward in a sort of "degenerate" condition. We can tell
whether a frame represents a reaction by looking to see if its has
#$GO.REACTION in its ISA slot, so here a new version of
GO-REACTION-CAN-GO-FORWARD? that takes this into account:

<pre>
>> (defun go-reaction-can-go-forward? (go-frame env)
>>   (when (member #$go.reaction (#^isa go-frame))
>>     (loop for reactant in (#^go.reactants go-frame)
>>           when (not (member reactant env))
>>           do (return nil)
>>           finally (return t))))

;;; And let's try again:

>> (possible-reactions *env*)
:: 
(#$GO.GtpDiphosphokinaseActivity 
 #$GO.GuanylateCyclaseActivity
 #$GO.Hydrogen-TransportingAtpSynthaseActivity,RotationalMechanism
 #$GO.ReceptorGuanylateCyclaseActivity
 #$GO.AtpAdenylyltransferaseActivity 
 #$GO.Nad+KinaseActivity
 #$GO.2'-5'-OligoadenylateSynthetaseActivity
 #$GO.AdenylateCyclaseActivity)
</pre>

Ahhhhh. Much better!

<p>

Now, we actually need a very slightly different form called
(previously) possible-reactions-from which lets us specify that we've
come from a particular molecule:

<pre>
>> (defun possible-reactions-from (from env)
>>   (loop for frame in *go-frames*
>>         when (and (member from (#^go.reactants frame))
>>                   (go-reaction-can-go-forward? frame env))
>>         collect frame))
</pre>

<p>

Okay, we should be ready to find paths based upon the Gene Ontology
reaction definitions, instead of our couple of dozen manually
installed reactions.  We'll actually have to make two very small
changes to FPATHSTO, and its underlying functions to use built-in Gene
Ontology frames instead of the structures we used in the previous lesson:

<pre>
;;; These are identical to the way it was done before:

>> (defun apply-reaction (reaction-frame env)
>>   (append env
>>           (loop for product in (#^go.products reaction-frame)
>>                 collect product)))

>> (defun paths (env goal &optional path)
>>   (cond ((find goal env) (list path)) ; Found the goal: Done!
>>         (t (loop for reaction in (loop for reaction in (possible-reactions env)
>>                                        when (not (member reaction path))
>>                                        collect reaction)
>>                  append (paths (apply-reaction reaction env) 
>>                                goal 
>>                                (cons reaction path))))
>>         ))

>> (defun superset? (s1 s2)
>>   (and (>= (length s1) (length s2))
>>        (every #'(lambda (s) (member s s1 :test #'equal)) s2)))

>> (defun paths-between (from to &optional (env *env*) path)
>>   (cond ((member to env) (list path))
>>         (t (loop for reaction in (possible-reactions-from from env)
>>                  when (not (member reaction path))
>>                  append (paths-via (cons reaction path) to 
>>                                    (apply-reaction reaction env))))
>>         ))

;;; This is the same, although we don't have the S-type constraint anymore:
>> (defun paths-via (path to env)
>>   (loop for link-mol in (#^go.products (car path))
>>         append (paths-between link-mol to env path)))

;;; This is simpler (and is a function, not a macro) 
;;; because we are giving specific molecule frames:

>> (defun fpathsto (from to)
>>   (length (setq *pathways* 
>>                  (remove-duplicates
>>                     (paths-between from to *env*)
>>                     :test #'superset?))))

</pre>

Notice that the changes we've made above in no way change the
<i>logic</i> of the old dynamic pathway creation code; They are just
fixes that enable us to use the new reaction representation that we
scraped out of the Gene Ontology!

<p>

Also notice that I've added back the old REMOVE-DUPLICATE-PATHS call, which
I couldn't decide on whether we wanted it or not in the first Pathway
Logic section.  That's  because there are so many possible paths now that
it helps to just have the minimal pathway in order to see what's going
on.  

<p>

Okay, so now we're ready to give it a go!  (I've repeated the whole
sequence here; You probably don't have to re-do the initializations if
you've been working through this whole section line-by-line, although
it can't hurt!)

<pre>
>> (init-env)

;;; Testing the thing:

>> (fpathsto #$MOL.d-Glucose #$MOL.D-Glucose6-Phosphate)
:: 1

;;; Okay, let's take a look:

>> *pathways*
:: ((#$GO.GlucokinaseActivity))

;;; Prefect! Let's try going a little farther:

>> (fpathsto #$MOL.d-Glucose #$MOL.D-Fructose6-Phosphate)
:: 1

;;; Again, lets see it

>> *pathways*
:: ((#$GO.Glucose-6-PhosphateIsomeraseActivity #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity))

;;; Looking good! (Remember that the last reaction to run 
;;; appears at the head (first) in this list!)

>> (fpathsto #$mol.d-glucose #$MOL.AcetylPhosphate )
:: 1

>> *pathways*

::
((#$GO.Fructose-6-PhosphatePhosphoketolaseActivity
  #$GO.Glucose-6-PhosphateIsomeraseActivity #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity))

;;; Excellenta!

;;; Let's try to go someplace we think we can't get to:

>> (fpathsto #$mol.d-glucose #$MOL.N6-Acetyl-L-Lysine)
:: 
*** TIMEOUT ! TIMEOUT ! TIMEOUT ***
*** COMPUTATION ABORTED AFTER 10 SECONDS ***
*** YOU CAN: 
***   - contact support for help: BioLinguaSupport@lists.Stanford.EDU
***   - use SET-TIMELIMIT to extend your timeout up to 1 hour
***   - use RUNJOB to run your code in a separate process
***   - type (explain-timeout) at the weblistener for detailed info.

</pre>

Hmmm. Well, I suppose that's what we would expect: It's trying every
possible pathway in the whole GO to get to where you've asked it to
go, and can't find its way. 

<p>

We could expand this by adding various sorts of search constraints to
make the search faster, or to have it bottom out at a certain length
of pathway, but those are nuances. This is good enough for a single
lesson.

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p><hr></p>

<font color=brown>NOTE: These exercises refer to the <i>previous
tutorial</i> -- that is, where *env* is a list of symbols, <i>NOT</i>
the GO entries! They are here because the previous tutorial was so
long that I figured you needed a break. You may want to go back and
"press the DOITs" through that tutorial in order to get back to that
state in order to do these.</font>

<p><hr></p>

1. Here's most of a function that gives you all the subsets a set:

<pre>
  (defun all-subsets (l)
        (if (null l)
            (list nil)
            (append (loop for i in (all-subsets (cdr l))
                          collect (cons (car l) i))
                    ?????????????????????)))

Example:
>> (all-subsets '(a s d f))
:: 
((A S D F) (A S D) (A S F) (A S) (A D F) (A D) (A F) (A) 
 (S D F) (S D) (S F) (S) (D F) (D) (F) NIL)

</pre>

Finish off the missing recursive call, and test this function. (Hint,
the number of question-marks in the missing piece represents the
correct number of characters in the solution!) 

<p>

Use your new function to determine how many combinations are there of
the original 9 environment variables?

<p>

Now use all-subsets to find the minimum possible environment for
glucose to pyruvate metabolism in the current enzymatic environment
(that is, given the reaction set that we have). 

<p>

Next, you'll want to write a function that loops over all the subsets
(that is, loops over the results of ALL-SUBSETS, as above), and sets
the *env* to each one in turn, and sees if there's a path between glu
and pyr (just like we did above). If there is, collect it, and when
you're done, find the smallest of these (by sorting, for example). How
many of the subsets of the orignal *env* work to take glucose to
pyruvate? What is the minimal environment?

<p>

Here's a useful trick: If you want to temporarily set the value of a
DEFVAR -- that is, a special or global variable (as *ENV* is -- note
that we DEFVAR'ed it above!) all you need to do is to "LET" bind
it. That is:

<pre>
  (let ((*env* whatever-its-new-value-is))
     whatever-computation-you-want-to-do)

Example:
>> (defvar glb1)

>> (defvar glb2)

>> (defun dumb-function ()
>>   (* glb1 glb2))

>> (setf glb1 '(a s d f)  glb2 "this is a string, not a number!")

This will cause an error:

>> (dumb-function)
   Error: Evaluation failed. Actual error:
         `(A S D F)' is not of the expected type `NUMBER'
          Use (EXPLAIN) to see a stack trace.

But if we let bind glb1 and glb2, it will work!

>> (let* ((glb1 (+ 5 7))
>>        (glb2 (expt glb1 3)))
>>    (dumb-function))
:: 20736

And the values of glb1 and glb2 are not affected:

>> (list glb1 glb2)
:: ((A S D F) "this is a string, not a number!")

</pre>

Note that the values of glb1 and glb2 were LOCALLY BOUND by the
LET*. You can do the same thing for *ENV*, and then call your new
defun version of fpathsto

<p><hr></p>

2. Do the same thing to find the minimum set of <i>reactions</i>.

<p><hr></p>

3. What aspects of this tutorial could be improved? Does it fit well with
the previous tutorials? Does it need something introduced before hand
that we failed to introduce? Any typos or confusing parts? Were the
exercises useful? Any other feedback?
