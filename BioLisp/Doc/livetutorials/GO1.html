In the last tutorial we learned about representing graphs and walking
around in them using recursive functions. The recursive function part
probably went right over your head, so in this lesson we'll do it
again in order to make the lesson sick. Actually, we're going to be
working with a much more interesting graph this time: The Gene
Ontology graph.


<p>

The Gene Ontology (usually called "GO" for short) is an explicit
representation of some aspects of the many biological processes that
can be implemented by proteins, which are, of course, coded for by
genes.  Using such knowledge, we can do a variety of interesting
knowledge-based analyses.  For example, we might want to ask whether
one process is a kind of another process: for example, is glucokinase
activity is a kind of kinase activity?  In this case it's sort of
obvious from the name, but that's not always true.  The Gene Ontology
lets you asked questions of that sort, and many others besides.

<p>

GO is intended to capture the concepts related to the functions of
biological entities (such as enzymes) and their relationships to one
another.  We might want to ask specific sorts of questions, like: "Is
Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase a transporter?" (Yes) "Is it an
oxidoreductase?"  (Yes) "Is it an atp-ase?"  (No) In this lesson we'll
develop code to do just that, and along the way, learn about how the
Gene Ontology is represented in BioLingua.

<p>

These sorts of questions can be answered by using an explicit
representation of biological function. In this case, we used a popular
representation called the "Gene Ontology" (or "GO"). GO is intended to
capture the concepts related to the functions of biological entities
(such as enzymes) and their relationships to one another.

<p>

The Gene Ontology is built into BioBike as a frame network, so you
don't have to do anything at all in order to use it. There's also a
global variable that contains <i>all</i> of the GO frames:

<pre>
>> (length *go-frames*)
:: 23080      ; This may vary for you if the GO has been updated
</pre>

There are around 20 thousand "terms" in the gene ontology (as of the
point at which we downloaded that particular instance, which is
sometime in 2005).

<p>

You can click on any of them to see what's inside. Let's see how many
have "nadph" in their name:

<pre>
>> (search-frames '("go." "nadph") :slots #$fname)
:: 
(#$GO.[Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoaReductase[Nadph]]KinaseActivity
 #$GO.SulfiteReductase[Nadph]Activity #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity

 ...)

;; I've abbreviated long stuff with "...", and added dashes to 
;; make it more clear where the breaks are in the display.

>> (length *)
</pre>

Oh my, that's quite a list! We'll just pick one to work on for the
moment:

<pre>
>> (setq np #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)

>> (df np)

Slots of #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity:
#$GO.goid: 3959
#$Source: :GO
#$GO.prettyname: "NADPH dehydrogenase activity"
#$GO.Namespace: #$Go.Molecular_Function
#$GO.definition: "Catalysis of the reaction: NADPH + H+ + acceptor = NADP+ + reduced acceptor."
#$isA:  (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
         #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
#$GO.ECRef: (#$EC.1.6.99.1)
#$GO.DBXRefs: (("EC" "1.6.99.1"))
#$Go.reactants: (#$MOL.Nadph #$MOL.H+ #$MOL.Acceptor)
#$Go.products: (#$MOL.Nadp+ #$MOL.ReducedAcceptor)

</pre>

First, notice that the real name of this concept (the value of the
PRETTYNAME slot) is "NADPH dehydrogenase <i>activity</i>" --
"Activity" is what the GO uses to talk about biological processes or
functions.

<p>

The most important slot is ISA (for "is a").  "ISA" -- that is: "Is an
instance of..."  is <i>the fundamental relationship</i> of the GO
database.  Notice that ISA contains a lot of other GO
frames. Basically, it's saying that the current concept (NADPH
dehydrogenase activity) <i>is an example of</i> each of these
others. That is, it <i>is a</i> REACTION, and it <i>is an</i>
OXIDOREDUCTASE ACTIVITY, and so forth.

<p>

Now, the important thing here is that each of <i>those</i> concepts
also has an ISA slot. Let's look at one (you can just click through to
it, but we'll DF it here for show):

<pre>
>> (df #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)

Slots of #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity:
#$Go.Related-Genes: (#$S6803.slr1562 #$S6803.sll0741 #$S6803.slr0623
                     #$S6803.ssr1041 #$S6803.sll0685 #$S6803.slr0233
                     ...
                     #$S6803.slr1846 #$S6803.sll1057)
#$GO.goid: 5489
#$Source: :GO
#$subClasses: (#$GO.MethaneMonooxygenaseActivity
               #$GO.PhthalateDioxygenaseReductaseActivity
               #$GO.RubredoxinReductaseActivity
               ...
               #$GO.NadhDehydrogenaseActivity)
#$GO.prettyname: "electron transporter activity"
#$GO.Namespace: #$Go.Molecular_Function
#$GO.definition: "Enables the directed movement of electrons into, out of, within or between cells."
#$isA:  (#$GO.TransporterActivity)
#$GO.DBXRefs: (("GO" "ai"))
</pre>

Notice that this has a slot called SUBCLASSES which contains our
original #$GO.NadhDehydrogenaseActivity. These are all the things that
<i>is a</i> ELECTRONTRANSPORTERACTIVITY... so we've got siblings! If
we looked at each of those, each would have
#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity in their ISA slot (possibly among
other things).

<p>

The other thing to notice is that this isn't the end of the ISA line;
#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity ISA #$GO.TransporterActivity, and so
on up. (Demonstrate this to yourself: Click up the isa tree -- how
many more steps can you go up ISAs before you run out of them?

Now, you can obviously repeat tracing the references and continue up
the chain of abstract functions.  Let's follow up from 
#$GO.TransporterActivity:

<pre>
>> (#^isa #$GO.TransporterActivity)
:: (#$GO.Molecular_Function)
>> (#^isa #$GO.Molecular_Function)
:: NIL
</pre>

So molecular function is the end of the isa chain -- or, put another
way: the top of the ISA tree.

<p>

Our first goal will be to write a function that crawls up this ISA
chain (usually called an "isa hierarchy"), just like we just did by
hand! Here's the function that does that:

<pre>
>>(defun walk-isas (child)
>>  (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>        do (walk-isas parent)))
</pre>

This doesn't do any printing or collecting of the results, so we have
to trace it in order to see it run:

<pre>
>> (trace walk-isas)

>> (walk-isas np)

 0[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
   1[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$Go.Reaction)
   1[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph)
     2[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity)
       3[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.CatalyticActivity)
         4[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$Go.Molecular_Function)
         4[7]: returned NIL
       3[7]: returned NIL
     2[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
     2[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.TransporterActivity)
       3[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$Go.Molecular_Function)
       3[7]: returned NIL
     2[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: returned NIL
 0[7]: returned NIL
</pre>

If you carefully examine that trace, you'll see that it walked all the
way up each branch of the ISA hierarchy leading up from our friend,
#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity, the thioredoxin reductase.  Let's put
in some informational printing so that we can see what it's doing a
little more clearly:

<pre>
>> (defun walk-isas (child &optional (depth 0))
>>   (loop for space from 1 to (* 2 depth) do (format t " "))
>>   (format t "~a: ~a~%" depth (#^go.prettyname child))
>>   (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>         do (walk-isas parent (incf depth))))
</pre>

>> (untrace)

>> (walk-isas np)

0: NADPH dehydrogenase activity
  1: NIL
    2: oxidoreductase activity, acting on NADH or NADPH
      3: oxidoreductase activity
        4: catalytic activity
          5: molecular_function
      3: electron transporter activity
        4: transporter activity
          5: molecular_function
</pre>

Reading backwards, you can see that there are two separate function
chains leading to NADPH dehydrogenase activity.  One deals with its
transportation function, and the other deals with its function as an
oxidoreductase.

<p>

It's a very short way, now, to being able to answer rather complex
questions about biological concepts, like those at the beginning of
this lesson! We know where to get the information, all we need now is
to get it in a useable form, and use it the right way.

<p>

Let's start by rewriting WALK-ISAS to actually give them back instead
of just printing them out:

<pre>
>> (defun ancestors-of (child)
>>  (cons child
>>         (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>               collect (ancestors-of parent))))
</pre>

This is just like our WALK-ISAS function from above, except that it it
returns the path as a tree (a Lisp list with recursive sublists).
Let's see how it works:

<pre>
>> (ancestors-of np)
:: (#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity (#$Go.Reaction)
 (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
  (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity
   (#$GO.CatalyticActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))
 (#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
  (#$GO.TransporterActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))
</pre>

That long complex list of lists of lists is just a numerical form of
the result of WALK-ISA from above!

<p>

Okay, so we should be ready to ask (and answer) the question: "Is
nadph dehydrogenase a transporter?"  We'd like to be able to say
something like: (is? "nadph dehydrogenase" a "transporter").  The
function to do that is just the same as ANCESTORS-OF, except that it
doesn't have to collect the results, just say YES (T) or NO (NIL):

<pre>
>> (defun isa? (child target-parent)
>>  (or (equal child target-parent) ; Got it!
>>      (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>            do (if (isa? parent target-parent)
>>                   (return t)))))

>> (isa? np #$GO.TransporterActivity)
:: T
>> (isa? np  #$MOL.ReducedAcceptor)
:: NIL
</pre>

Tada!

<p>

By the way, we don't have to start at a "ground" object (like "nadh
dehydrogenase"); we can just as easily ask:

<pre>
>> (isa? #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity #$GO.TransporterActivity)
</pre>
(Of course it is!)

<p>

Now, unfortunately, all of this good work doesn't let us type the
questions in in English; we have to be very precise about indicating
exactly which concepts -- that is, which frames -- we're referring
to. But that's life in computational biology. In another lesson we'll
see how to do some simple "natural language" processing -- that will
help you be able to ask questions in a more natural way, but for now,
this is a pretty good start.

<p>

Now, suppose that, instead of walking "up" the GO hierarchy as we did
above, we wanted to walk "down" it.  That is, for example,
suppose that we wanted to know what all of the oxidoreductases are.

<p>

Recall that there was a SUBCLASSES slot in each frame that contained
the frames immediate children.  So, walking DOWN is straightforward;
all we have to do is use that slot to recursively find all the
children, grandchildren, great grand children, great great .... you
get the idea.  In Lisp this sort of thing is simple:

<pre>
>> (defun descendants-of (me)
>>     (cond ((null me) nil) ; Stop when there are no children.
>>          (t (cons me 
>>                   (loop for child in (#^subclasses me)
>>                         collect (descendants-of child))))
>>     ))

>> (descendants-of #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
:: 
(#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
 ...
 (#$GO.MethaneMonooxygenaseActivity)
 (#$GO.PhthalateDioxygenaseReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.RubredoxinReductaseActivity
  (#$GO.Rubredoxin-Nad[P]+ReductaseActivity)
  (#$GO.Rubredoxin-Nad+ReductaseActivity))
 (#$GO.LeghemoglobinReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.Trypanothione-DisulfideReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.ElectronCarrierActivity
  (#$GO.GlutathioneDehydrogenase[Ascorbate]Activity)
  (#$GO.Plastoquinol-PlastocyaninReductaseActivity))
 (#$GO.ElectronAcceptorActivity) (#$GO.ElectronDonorActivity)
 (#$GO.FerredoxinReductaseActivity
  (#$GO.Nadph-AdrenodoxinReductaseActivity)
  (#$GO.Ferredoxin-Nad+ReductaseActivity)
  (#$GO.Ferredoxin-Nadp+ReductaseActivity))
 (#$GO.Thioredoxin-DisulfideReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.SulfiteReductase[Nadph]Activity)
 (#$GO.Glutathione-DisulfideReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.DihydrolipoylDehydrogenaseActivity)
 (#$GO.Cytochrome-B5ReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
 (#$GO.Nadph-HemoproteinReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenaseActivity
  (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenase[Quinone]Activity
   (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenase[Ubiquinone]Activity))))
</pre>

Long list -- or, rather, big tree!

<p><hr><p>

<b>Slightly More Complex Symbolic Computing</b>

<p>

Now, given our capabilities to find all the ancestors and descendants
of a given node, we can do some simple and interesting calculations.
For example, we can find the concepts that are shared between a number
of concepts; That is, those along all the paths up the tree.  You'd
expect that concepts that are close together would share lots of
common ancestors, whereas one that are farther apart would share
fewer.

<p>

Here's a function that does this intersection:

<pre>
>> (defun parent-intersection (concepts)
>>   (reduce 'intersection 
>>          (loop for concept in concepts
>>                collect (flatten (ancestors-of concept)))))
</pre>

This does this The Hard Way, that is, by successive flattened
intersections, which is pretty inefficient.  Let's try it out:

<pre>
>> (parent-intersection '(#$GO.PhosphoglucokinaseActivity #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity))
:: 
(#$Go.Molecular_Function #$GO.CatalyticActivity
 #$GO.TransferaseActivity
 #$GO.TransferaseActivity,TransferringPhosphorus-ContainingGroups
 #$GO.KinaseActivity #$Go.Molecular_Function #$GO.CatalyticActivity
 #$GO.TransferaseActivity
 #$GO.TransferaseActivity,TransferringPhosphorus-ContainingGroups
 #$GO.PhosphotransferaseActivity,AlcoholGroupAsAcceptor #$Go.Reaction)

;;; Let's try some concepts that are farther apart:

>> (parent-intersection '(#$GO.PhosphoglucokinaseActivity #$GO.MicrofilamentMotorActivity))
:: (#$GO.Molecular_Function #$GO.Molecular_Function)

</pre>

The last two share only the topmost node of the tree:
#$GO.Molecular_Function.  Oops. Why'd we get #$GO.Molecular_Function
twice? If you look carefully, what this function is doing is to
FLATTEN the paths returned by ANCESTORS-OF. But those are redundant!
Watch again:

<pre>
>> (ancestors-of np)
:: (#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity (#$Go.Reaction)
 (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
  (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity
   (#$GO.CatalyticActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))
 (#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
  (#$GO.TransporterActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))

>> (flatten *)
:: 
(#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity #$Go.Reaction
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity #$GO.CatalyticActivity
 #$Go.Molecular_Function #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
 #$GO.TransporterActivity #$Go.Molecular_Function)
</pre>

If you look carefully, you'll see that #$GO.Molecular_Function appears
<i>twice</i> in this list!  Well, that's okay, we can just remove the
duplicates:

<pre>
>> (remove-duplicates *)
:: 
(#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity #$Go.Reaction
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity #$GO.CatalyticActivity
 #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity #$GO.TransporterActivity
 #$Go.Molecular_Function)
</pre>

And now modify our function:

<pre>
>> (defun parent-intersection (concepts)
>>   (remove-duplicates 
>>      (reduce 'intersection 
>>          (loop for concept in concepts
>>                collect (flatten (ancestors-of concept))))))

;;; And check it out:

>> (parent-intersection '(#$GO.PhosphoglucokinaseActivity #$GO.MicrofilamentMotorActivity))
:: (#$GO.Molecular_Function)
</pre>
Voila!

<p>

Now, this actually gives is a pretty interesting tool; we can ask, for
any two GO concepts, what their distance is from one another, in these
terms.  Let's rank the GO concepts in terms of this 'distance'
(actually, it's sort of an inverse distance -- the bigger the number,
the closer the nodes are in 'go space'). Conceptually that's just two
loops, one inside the other running PARENT-INTERSECTION on every GO
concept against every other GO concept, collecting the distances and
then sort the result:

<pre>
<font color=red>;;; DO NOT EXECUTE THIS !!!</font>

    (sort 
      (loop with result = nil
            for go1 in *go-frames*
            do 
            (loop for go2 in *go-frames*
                  unless (eq go1 go2)
                  do 
                  (push (list go1 go2 
                             (length (parent-intersection (list go1 go2))))
                        result))
           finally (return result))
     #'> :key #'third)

</pre>

<font color=red> WAIT!  Don't do it! Unfortunately, nested loops like
this take a very long time because it will do about 20-thousand times
20-thousand comparisons! (This is called an "N-squared" operation:
20,000-squared)</font>

<p>

Instead, let's try it on a small subset of GO nodes:

<pre>
>> (setq 10gos 
>>      (loop with l = (length *go-frames*) 
>>            for i from 1 to 10 
>>            collect (nth (random l) *go-frames*)))

 #$GO.MaleGenitaliaMorphogenesis #$GO.Katanin
 #$GO.PropionateCoa-TransferaseActivity #$GO.Beta-1,6GlucanBiosynthesis

;;; (You'll probably get a different list than I did since this

Hmmmm.  Pretty interesting; Not sure what significance it could
have....?

<p><hr><p>

<b>Getting Abstract</b> (optional section)

<p>

It turns out that both our ANCESTORS-OF and DESCENDANTS-OF functions
are examples of the more general concept of a "transitive closure":
ANCESTORS-OF walks the "tree" using #^ISA, and DESCENDANTS-OF walks
the tree using #^SUBCLASSES, but in all other respects, they are the
same exact function!

<p>

It would be nice to have a generalized function, called something
like: TREE-WALKER which took a place to start, and a <i>function</i>
-- either #^ISA or #^SUBCLASSES depending upon which way we wanted to
go -- and just did the right thing. It turns out that that's pretty
easy to write in Lisp:

<pre>
>> (defun tree-walker (here by)

</pre>

The only thing new in this function is this line: 
<pre> 
  (funcall by here) 
</pre> 

All that that does is to apply the function in BY to the current frame
(HERE). Notice that the value that we assigned to BY in each call was
either #^ISA or #^SUBCLASSES -- that is, the functions that get the
values from the frames. So all that the funcall is doing is applying
whatever function you gave as the BY argument to the TREE-WALKER
call. This is exactly the same thing as calling it by have. Watch:

<pre>
>> (#^isa #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
:: (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
 #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
>> (funcall #^isa #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
:: (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
 #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
</pre>

See! Same thing! The only thing that FUNCALL does for us is to let us
use a variable to stand in for the function -- BY in the case of
TREE-WALKER. This seems like a samll thing, but it's actually a
<i>huge</i> thing because if lets you generalize any function to take
<i>other functions</i> as arguments!

Some day you'll learn to appreciate these simple lovely little things
about in Lisp! :-)

1. Note that some GO concepts tell you which genes they are associated with. For example:

<pre>
>> (#^Go.Related-Genes #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity)
:: (#$S6803.slr0329 #$S6803.sll0593 #$A7120.alr2973 #$PRO1375.Pro1065
    #$TeBP1.tlr2355 #$TeBP1.tll1495 #$Cwat.Cw?3086)
</pre>

Use what we've done in this tutorial to write a function that
intersects, appends, and removes the duplicates of the <i>genes</i>
associated with all the GO parents and children associated with a
given GO node (you can use #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity as your test
case). That is, you give it something like: 

<pre>
>> (my-function #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity)
</pre>

and it returns a long list of genes being collected via the
#^Go.Related-Genes slots of all the go frames that are all the parents
and children of #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity. (Make sure that you remove
duplicates on this list.)

<p>

Remember the SCORE-ALIGNMENT version of SUBSETS-BY-BEST that we just
wrote in the last tutorial? Try passing these genes to it.

<p><hr></p>

2. In addition to being able to get from GO concepts to genes through the
#^Go.Related-Genes slot of some GO concepts, some (though not all) of
these genes also have the inverse relationship as well, called #^go-id:

<pre>
>> (#^Go-Id #$A7120.alr2973)
:: (#$GO.KinaseActivity #$GO.TransferaseActivity #$GO.GlucokinaseActivity
    #$GO.AtpBinding #$GO.Glycolysis)
</pre>

Create a new function that calls on the above function, but instead of
reporting the genes themselves, collects up the #^go-ids referred to
by those genes. (This should be easy, given the above function -- it
just uses the above function's result and does some further
manipulation to it!)

<p><hr></p>

4. What aspects of this tutorial could be improved? Does it fit well with
the previous tutorials? Does it need something introduced before hand
that we failed to introduce? Any typos or confusing parts? Were the
exercises useful? Any other feedback?
