<h2>Introduction</h2>

Okay, so I've fixed the problems we were having this afternoon w/the 
constraint
solver, and I've attached our paper on this technique.

Let's start by getting you to the point where you can run the categorical
example yourself. I've copied over everything you need into your top level
BioBike directory and edited it to work.  All you should have to do is to log
into BioBike (that it, in the normal way, through the web browser 
into the main
server), and do the following:

>> (c/l "jkf.lisp")

then:

>> (setf g (jkf-test))

This will result in a graph, which you can visualize by:

>> (seegraph g)

(By the way, I still don't know what the :xinches ... argument does exactly on
seegraph, but if you do:

>> (seegraph g :xinches 500)

it's a least readably large!)

Anyway, so test that out, and work though the lisp code so that you see what
it's doing -- how it connects genes to categories and how it gets the
cross-correlations, and then lets get together next week.  (It may 
save you some
time if you want to take online notes while you're working through it, which
you'll be able to reformulate into lesson content later... of even just as
comments on the code!)
