In the tutorial on regulatory simulation (I - tutorial #5) we
replicated the results of a regulatory model due to Li et al. In this
one we're going to use that same model, but this time we're going to
try to go beyond just the simulation to do some anlaysis of the
behavior of the system. We'll see that with just a little work we can
ask some pretty intesting questions about regulation.

Let's start by getting the code from that lesson back, and testing it
out. You don't actually have to load it all back in function by
function (although going back through that lesson might be useful for
you if you don't remember it). We've hidden away the code from that
lesson in a file. All you have to do to get it back in is to load it
up:

<pre>
>> (ld "websrc:Doc;livetutorials;jssymbiolietal.lisp")
</pre>

Now we'll test it out. Recall that in that tutorial we modelled this
regulatory system:

<p>

Here's what Li et al. got in terms of simulated behavior:

<p>
<img src=livetutorial-files/regsim2/jssymbiolietaltable2.gif>
<p>

And here's what we get:

<pre>
>> (litest-pumped :cycles-to-run 500 :pump-frequency 50)
</pre>

Note that they specifically state that "the number of time steps in
each phase do [sic] not reflect its actual duration." Given that, can
you confirm that your results are the same as theirs? (Recall that
come of the protein states in their table have to considered as
wrapping around from the previous cycle, so begin your comparison
after the first pump action.)

<p>

Now. Notice that they named the various states: Start, G1, G2, S, M,
and stationary G1, and had a particular setting of on/off (1/0) values
for each protein for each of those states. Let's start by making a
table of those indentifier, and then try to apply the names to our
results. We'll make a global variable called *named-states* that tells
us what to look for for each protein in each named state. We'll list
the names of the proteins that are 1 (on) in each named state -- all
the others we'll assume are off (0). 

<p>

It turns out that Li et al aren't consistent about what they name
particular states -- which is probably intentional. So we'll have to
be a little careful about this. Let's give a major and minor state
indication. You'll see what this means in a moment:

<pre>
>> (defvar *named-states* nil)

>> (setf *named-states* 
>>  '(
>>    ((start) (CLN3 CDH1 SIC1 size))
>>    ((G1 a) (MBF SBF CDH1 SIC1))
>>    ((G1 b) (MBF SBF CLN12 CDH1 SIC1))
>>    ((G1 c) (MBF SBF CLN12))
>>    ((S) (MBF SBF CLN12 CLB56))
>>    ((G2) (MBF SBF CLN12 CLB56 CLB12 MCM1/SFF))
>>    ((M a) (CLN12 CDC20&14 CLB56 CLB12 MCM1/SFF))
>>    ((M b) (SWI5 CDC20&14 CLB12 MCM1/SFF))
>>    ((M c) (SWI5 CDC20&14 SIC1 CLB12 MCM1/SFF))
>>    ((M d) (CDH1 SWI5 CDC20&14 SIC1))
>>    ((G1 n) (CDH1 SWI5 SIC1)) ; n = near stationary
>>    ((G1 s) (CDH1 SIC1)) ; s = stantionary
>>   ))
</pre>

The FIRST of each entry in *named-states* is the description of the
state. You'd think that each state would be characterized by a
different specific set of proteins, but that's not the case for
whatever good reason Li et al had for doing it this way. So because Li
et al used the same name for apparently different states, we've given
some of the states a sub-name (a, b, c, etc.)

<p>

Now, in order to do what we want to do here, we're going to have to
change the reporting function from the last tutorial so that it
reports the state, instead of just the on/off (1/0) values for each
protien. 

<p>

Here's the old reporting function:

<pre>
 (defun report-states (cycle)
  (format t "~8,f" cycle)
   (loop for p in *proteins*
         do (format t "~9,f" (gethash p *protein->current-state*)))
   (format t "~%")
   )
</pre>

Since we can figure out that value of each protein, all we need to do
is ensure that the one's were interested in are 1, and all the rest
are zero:

<pre>
>> (defun check-state? (target-proteins)
>>   (and 
>>    ;; Make sure all the ones that should be one are one:
>>    (loop for p in target-proteins
>>          if (= 0 (gethash p *protein->current-state*))
>>          do (return nil)                ; found a zero -- fail!
>>          finally (return 1) ; Completed without a problem -- succeed (this part!)
>>          )
>>    ;; And make sure that all the others are zero!  Note the tricky use of 
>>    ;; set-difference here to get the list of proteins NOT in the target set!
>>    (loop for p in (set-difference *proteins* target-proteins)
>>          if (= 1 (gethash p *protein->current-state*))
>>          do (return nil)                ; found a one -- fail!
>>          finally (return 1) ; Completed without a problem -- succeed (this part!)
>>          )
>>    ))
</pre>

With this we should be able to get REPORT-STATES to tell us what state
the system is in at any point:

<pre>
>>  (defun report-states (cycle)
>>   (format t "In cycle: ~8,f, the system is in state: ~a~%" cycle 
>>           (loop for (state-description target-proteins) in *named-states*
>>                 when (check-state? target-proteins)
>>                 do (return state-description))))
</pre>

Let's try that. We have to use the pumped version of litest to see that this actually cycles around multiple times, as predicted:

<pre>
>> (litest-pumped :cycles-to-run 220 :pump-frequency 50)
</pre>

Hmmmm. After each pumping event We should get their state
progressions: 

<pre>
   Start -> G1a -> G1b -> G1c -> S -> G2 -> Ma
         -> Mb -> Mc -> Md -> G1n -> G1s... 

But it only does: 

   Start -> Mb -> Mc -> Md -> G1n -> G1s...
</pre>

<p>

<i>Why?!</i> It's hard to tell, but note that many states are NIL --
not named. Maybe some of the states are sort of mushed together, or
pulled apart as a result of a timing difference, and so aren't being
identified appropriately. That is, they aren't being activated or
inhibited enough. We have one parameter to play with: The
*degrade-after* parameter, which is set to 5. Let's explore setting it
to a smaller value to see if we get more of the right states:

<pre>
>> (setf *degrade-after* 3)

>> (litest-pumped :cycles-to-run 220 :pump-frequency 50)

;;; That's slighlty better: 

   Start -> S -> G2 -> Ma
         -> Mb -> Mc -> Md -> G1n -> G1s... 

>> (setf *degrade-after* 1)

>> (litest-pumped :cycles-to-run 220 :pump-frequency 50)

;;; Closer still:

   Start -> G1b -> G1c -> S -> G2 -> Ma
         -> Mb -> Mc -> Md -> G1n -> G1s... 

</pre>

The last version is only missing G1a, and there's a NIL state where it
should be, so maybe it's there afterall, but still a little mixed up.
At any rate, we're close enough at this point to accomplish what we
want to do, so let's move one, leaving *degrade-after* at 1.

<p>

Let's modify REPORT-STATES one more time, this time instead of
reporting the states, we want to collect them up in a history
list. We'll make the history list global, and then add a new outer
function that calls LITEST-PUMPED but records and reports the history
for us:

<pre>
>> (defvar *history* nil)   ; set up the global history

>>  (defun report-states (cycle)
>>     (push 
>>       (list cycle
>>         (loop for (state-description target-proteins) in *named-states*
>>               when (check-state? target-proteins)
>>               do (return state-description)))
>>         *history*))

;;; Because we PUSH the new state onto the history, it comes out in 
;;; reverse, so we have to reverse it when we finally report it.

>> (defun histest ()
>>  (setq *history* nil)
>>  (litest-pumped :cycles-to-run 220 :pump-frequency 50)
>>  (setq *history* (reverse *history*)))

;;; Let's try:

>> (histest)
::
((0 NIL) (1 NIL) (2 NIL) (3 NIL) (4 NIL) (5 NIL) (6 NIL) (7 NIL)
 (8 NIL) (9 (M B)) (10 (M C)) (11 NIL) (12 NIL) (13 (M D)) (14 (M D))
 (15 (G1 N)) (16 (G1 N)) (17 (G1 S)) (18 (G1 S)) (19 (G1 S))
 (20 (G1 S)) (21 (G1 S)) (22 (G1 S)) (23 (G1 S)) (24 (G1 S))
 (25 (G1 S)) (26 (G1 S)) (27 (G1 S)) (28 (G1 S)) (29 (G1 S))
 (30 (G1 S)) (31 (G1 S)) (32 (G1 S)) (33 (G1 S)) (34 (G1 S))
 (35 (G1 S)) (36 (G1 S)) (37 (G1 S)) (38 (G1 S)) (39 (G1 S))
 (40 (G1 S)) (41 (G1 S)) (42 (G1 S)) (43 (G1 S)) (44 (G1 S))
 (45 (G1 S)) (46 (G1 S)) (47 (G1 S)) (48 (G1 S)) (49 (G1 S))
 (50 (G1 S)) (51 (START)) (52 NIL) (53 (G1 B)) (54 (G1 C)) (55 (S))
 (56 (G2)) (57 (M A)) (58 NIL) (59 (M B)) (60 (M C)) (61 NIL) (62 NIL)
 (63 (M D)) (64 (M D)) (65 (G1 N)) (66 (G1 N)) (67 (G1 S)) (68 (G1 S))
 (69 (G1 S)) (70 (G1 S)) (71 (G1 S)) (72 (G1 S)) (73 (G1 S))
 (74 (G1 S)) (75 (G1 S)) (76 (G1 S)) (77 (G1 S)) (78 (G1 S))
 (79 (G1 S)) (80 (G1 S)) (81 (G1 S)) (82 (G1 S)) (83 (G1 S))
 (84 (G1 S)) (85 (G1 S)) (86 (G1 S)) (87 (G1 S)) (88 (G1 S))
 (89 (G1 S)) (90 (G1 S)) (91 (G1 S)) (92 (G1 S)) (93 (G1 S))
 (94 (G1 S)) (95 (G1 S)) (96 (G1 S)) (97 (G1 S)) (98 (G1 S))
 (99 (G1 S)) ...)

</pre>

Note that the first pump event happens at 50, so we really want only
to be reading from there onward. After that, it reads as expected:

<pre>
  START -> (G1 B) -> (G1 C) -> (S) -> (G2) -> (M A)
        -> (M B) -> (M C) -> (M D) -> (G1 N) -> (G1 S)....
</pre>

with a few NIL states in between, which we're ignoring for the moment.

<p>

We can simplify things a little; there are a lot of extra G1s final
states (while the cell is presumably growing). We can reduce this by
pumping at higher frequency, and doing far fewer cycles in the total
history:

<pre>
>> (defun histest ()
>>  (setq *history* nil)
>>  (litest-pumped :cycles-to-run 100 :pump-frequency 20)
>>  (setq *history* (reverse *history*)))

>> (histest)

;;; So *history* now contains the record of the run through a 
;;; number of cell cycles:

>> *history*

</pre>

Okay, so now we're ready to proceed with the task at hand: Analysis of
the cell cycle model based upon this <i>symbolic</i> behavior
history. The way that we're going to do this is by making
"hypotheses", or "theorems" about the behavior, and then testing them
(or "proving" them) by examination of the behavioral trace.
