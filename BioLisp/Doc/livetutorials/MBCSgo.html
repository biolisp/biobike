In this lesson we're going to do some simple <i>symbolic</i>
computational biology -- that is, Artificial Intelligence applied to
biological problems.

<p>

Our goal in this case is to be able to ask relational questions about
biological concepts. What is, we want to be able to ask questions like:

<pre>
Is nadph dehydrogenase a transporter? (It is)
Is nadph dehydrogenase an oxidoreductase? (It is)
Is nadph dehydrogenase an atpase? (It's not)
Is flavin-containing electron transporter a transporter? 
  (it obviously is)
</pre>

<p>

These sorts of questions can be answered by using an explicit
representation of biological function. In this case, we used a popular
representation called the "Gene Ontology" (or "GO"). GO is intended to
capture the concepts related to the functions of biological entities
(such as enzymes) and their relationships to one another.

<p>

The Gene Ontology is built into BioBike as a frame network, so you
don't have to do anything at all in order to use it. There's also a
global variable that contains <i>all</i> of the GO frames:

<pre>
>> (length *go-frames*)
:: 23080      ; This may vary for you if the GO has been updated
</pre>

There are around 20 thousand "terms" in the gene ontology (as of the
point at which we downloaded that particular instance, which is
sometime in 2005).

<p>

You can click on any of them to see what's inside. Let's see how many have "nadph" in their name:

<pre>
>> (search-frames '("go." "nadph") :slots #$fname)
:: 
(#$GO.[Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoaReductase[Nadph]]KinaseActivity
 #$GO.SulfiteReductase[Nadph]Activity #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity
 #$GO.NadphDehydrogenase[Quinone]Activity #$GO.NadphPeroxidaseActivity
 #$GO.Nadph-AdrenodoxinReductaseActivity
 #$GO.[Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoaReductase[Nadph]]-PhosphataseActivity
 #$GO.MevaldateReductase[Nadph]Activity
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph,WithOxygenAsAcceptor
 #$GO.Enoyl-[Acyl-CarrierProtein]Reductase[Nadph,B-Specific]Activity
 #$GO.Enoyl-[Acyl-CarrierProtein]Reductase[Nadph,A-Specific]Activity
 #$GO.Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoaReductase[Nadph]Activity
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph,QuinoneOrSimilarCompoundAsAcceptor
 #$GO.Indole-3-AcetaldehydeReductase[Nadph]Activity
 #$GO.Nadph:QuinoneReductaseActivity #$GO.NadphRegeneration
 #$GO.Superoxide-GeneratingNadphOxidaseActivatorActivity
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph,DisulfideAsAcceptor
 #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph,NadOrNadpAsAcceptor
 #$GO.GlutamateBiosynthesis,UsingGlutamateSynthase[Nadph]
 #$GO.Nadph-HemoproteinReductaseActivity
 #$GO.NitrateReductase[Nadph]Activity
 #$GO.1,2-DehydroreticuliniumReductase[Nadph]Activity
 ...)

>> (length *)
</pre>

Oh my, that's quite a list! We'll just pick one to work on for the
moment:

<pre>
>> (setq np #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)

>> (df np)

Slots of #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity:
#$GO.goid: 3959
#$Source: :GO
#$GO.prettyname: "NADPH dehydrogenase activity"
#$GO.Namespace: #$Go.Molecular_Function
#$GO.definition: "Catalysis of the reaction: NADPH + H+ + acceptor = NADP+ + reduced acceptor."
#$isA:  (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
         #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
#$GO.ECRef: (#$EC.1.6.99.1)
#$GO.DBXRefs: (("EC" "1.6.99.1"))
#$Go.reactants: (#$MOL.Nadph #$MOL.H+ #$MOL.Acceptor)
#$Go.products: (#$MOL.Nadp+ #$MOL.ReducedAcceptor)

</pre>

The meaning of some of these slots is obvious, like the PRETTYNAME and
DEFINITION; but a few are obscure, like ISA and DBXREFS.  

<p>

The most important of the obscure slots is ISA (for "is a").  "ISA" --
that is: "Is an instance of..."  is <i>the fundamental
relationship</i> of the GO database.  Notice that ISA contains a lot
of other GO frames. Bascially, it's saying that the current concept
(NADPH dehydrogenase activity) <i>is an example of</i> each of these
others. That is, it <i>is a</i> REACTION, and it <i>is an</i>
OXIDOREDUCTASE ACTIVITY, and so forth.

<p>

Now, the important thing here is that each of <i>those</i> concepts
also has an ISA slot. Let's look at one (you can just click through to
it, but we'll DF it here for show):

<pre>
>> (df #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)

Slots of #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity:
#$Go.Related-Genes: (#$S6803.slr1562 #$S6803.sll0741 #$S6803.slr0623
                     #$S6803.ssr1041 #$S6803.sll0685 #$S6803.slr0233
                     ...
                     #$S6803.slr1846 #$S6803.sll1057)
#$GO.goid: 5489
#$Source: :GO
#$subClasses: (#$GO.MethaneMonooxygenaseActivity
               #$GO.PhthalateDioxygenaseReductaseActivity
               #$GO.RubredoxinReductaseActivity
               ...
               #$GO.NadhDehydrogenaseActivity)
#$GO.prettyname: "electron transporter activity"
#$GO.Namespace: #$Go.Molecular_Function
#$GO.definition: "Enables the directed movement of electrons into, out of, within or between cells."
#$isA:  (#$GO.TransporterActivity)
#$GO.DBXRefs: (("GO" "ai"))
</pre>

Notice that this has a slot called SUBCLASSES which contains our
original #$GO.NadhDehydrogenaseActivity. These are all the things that
<i>is a</i> ELECTRONTRANSPORTERACTIVITY... so we've got siblings! If
we looked at each of those, each would have
#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity in their ISA slot (possibly among
other things).

<p>

The other thing to notice is that this isn't the end of the ISA line;
#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity ISA #$GO.TransporterActivity, and so
on up. (Demonstrate this to yourself: Click up the isa tree -- how
many more steps can you go up ISAs before you run out of them?

<p>

Our first goal will be to write a function that crawls up this ISA
chain (usually called an "isa hierarchy"), just like we just did by
hand! Here's the function that does that:

<pre>
>>(defun walk-isas (child)
>>  (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>        do (walk-isas parent)))
</pre>

This doesn't do any printing or collecting of the results, so we have
to trace it in order to see it run:

<pre>
>> (trace walk-isas)

>> (walk-isas np)

 0[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
   1[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$Go.Reaction)
   1[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph)
     2[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity)
       3[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.CatalyticActivity)
         4[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$Go.Molecular_Function)
         4[7]: returned NIL
       3[7]: returned NIL
     2[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
     2[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$GO.TransporterActivity)
       3[7]: (WALK-ISAS #$Go.Molecular_Function)
       3[7]: returned NIL
     2[7]: returned NIL
   1[7]: returned NIL
 0[7]: returned NIL
</pre>

If you carefully examine that trace, you'll see that it walked all the
way up each branch of the ISA hierarchy leading up from our friend,
#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity, the thioredoxin reductase.  Let's put
in some informational printing so that we can see what it's doing a
little more clearly:

<pre>
>> (defun walk-isas (child &optional (depth 0))
>>   (loop for space from 1 to (* 2 depth) do (format t " "))
>>   (format t "~a: ~a~%" depth (#^go.prettyname child))
>>   (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>         do (walk-isas parent (incf depth))))
</pre>

>> (untrace)

>> (walk-isas np)

0: NADPH dehydrogenase activity
  1: NIL
    2: oxidoreductase activity, acting on NADH or NADPH
      3: oxidoreductase activity
        4: catalytic activity
          5: molecular_function
      3: electron transporter activity
        4: transporter activity
          5: molecular_function
</pre>

Reading backwards, you can see that there are two separate function
chains leading to NADPH dehydrogenase activity.  One deals with its
transportation function, and the other deals with its function as an
oxidoreductase.

<p>

It's a very short way, now, to being able to answer rather complex
questions about biological concepts, like those at the beginning of
this lesson! We know where to get the information, all we need now is
to get it in a useable form, and use it the right way.

<p>

Let's start by rewriting WALK-ISAS to actually give them back instead
of just printing them out:

<pre>
>> (defun ancestors-of (child)
>>  (cons child
>>        (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>              collect (ancestors-of parent))))
</pre>

This is just like our WALK-ISAS function from above, except that it it
returns the path as a tree (a Lisp list with recursive sublists).
Let's see how it works:

<pre>
>> (ancestors-of np)
:: (#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity (#$Go.Reaction)
 (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
  (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity
   (#$GO.CatalyticActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))
 (#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
  (#$GO.TransporterActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))
</pre>

That long complex list of lists of lists is just a numerical form of
the result of WALK-ISA from above!

<p>

Okay, so we should be ready to ask (and answer) the question: "Is
nadph dehydrogenase a transporter?"  We'd like to be able to say
something like: (is? "nadph dehydrogenase" a "transporter").  The
function to do that is just the same as ANCESTORS-OF, except that it
doesn't have to collect the results, just say YES (T) or NO (NIL):

<pre>
>> (defun isa? (child target-parent)
>>  (or (equal child target-parent) ; Got it!
>>      (loop for parent in (#^isa child)
>>            do (if (isa? parent target-parent)
>>                   (return t)))))

>> (isa? np #$GO.TransporterActivity)
:: T
>> (isa? np  #$MOL.ReducedAcceptor)
:: NIL
</pre>

Tada!

<p>

By the way, we don't have to start at a "ground" object (like "nadh
dehydrogenase"); we can just as easily ask:

<pre>
>> (isa? #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity #$GO.TransporterActivity)
</pre>
(Of course it is!)

<p>

Now, unfortunately, all of this good work doesn't let us type the
questions in in English; we have to be very precise about indicating
exactly which concepts -- that is, which frames -- we're referring
to. But that's life in computational biology. In another lesson we'll
see how to do some simple "natural language" processing -- that will
help you be able to ask questions in a more natural way, but for now,
this is a pretty good start.

<p>

Now, suppose that, instead of walking "up" the GO hierarchy as we did
above, we wanted to walk "down" it.  That is, for example,
suppose that we wanted to know what all of the oxidoreductases are.

<p>

Recall that there was a SUBCLASSES slot in each frame that contained
the frames immediate children.  So, walking DOWN is strainghtforward;
all we have to do is use that slot to recursively find all the
children, grandchildren, great grand children, great great .... you
get the idea.  In Lisp this sort of thing is simple:

<pre>
>> (defun descendants-of (me)
>>     (cond ((null me) nil) ; Stop when there are no children.
>>          (t (cons me 
>>                   (loop for child in (#^subclasses me)
>>                         collect (descendants-of child))))
>>     ))

>> (descendants-of #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
:: 
(#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
 ...
 (#$GO.MethaneMonooxygenaseActivity)
 (#$GO.PhthalateDioxygenaseReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.RubredoxinReductaseActivity
  (#$GO.Rubredoxin-Nad[P]+ReductaseActivity)
  (#$GO.Rubredoxin-Nad+ReductaseActivity))
 (#$GO.LeghemoglobinReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.Trypanothione-DisulfideReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.ElectronCarrierActivity
  (#$GO.GlutathioneDehydrogenase[Ascorbate]Activity)
  (#$GO.Plastoquinol-PlastocyaninReductaseActivity))
 (#$GO.ElectronAcceptorActivity) (#$GO.ElectronDonorActivity)
 (#$GO.FerredoxinReductaseActivity
  (#$GO.Nadph-AdrenodoxinReductaseActivity)
  (#$GO.Ferredoxin-Nad+ReductaseActivity)
  (#$GO.Ferredoxin-Nadp+ReductaseActivity))
 (#$GO.Thioredoxin-DisulfideReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.SulfiteReductase[Nadph]Activity)
 (#$GO.Glutathione-DisulfideReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.DihydrolipoylDehydrogenaseActivity)
 (#$GO.Cytochrome-B5ReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
 (#$GO.Nadph-HemoproteinReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenaseActivity
  (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenase[Quinone]Activity
   (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenase[Ubiquinone]Activity))))
</pre>

Long list -- or, rather, big tree!

<p>

<b>Getting Abstract</b> (optional section)

<p>

It turns out that both our ANCESTORS-OF and DESCENDANTS-OF functions
are examples of the more general concept of a "transitive closure":
ANCESTORS-OF walks the "tree" using #^ISA, and DESCENDANTS-OF walks
the tree using #^SUBCLASSES, but in all other respects, they are the
same exact function!

<p>

It would be nice to have a generalized function, called something
like: TREE-WALKER which took a place to start, and a <i>function</i>
-- either #^ISA or #^SUBCLASSES depending upon which way we wanted to
go -- and just did the right thing. It turns out that that's pretty
easy to write in Lisp:

<pre>
>> (defun tree-walker (here by)
>>   ;; by is the function to use to walk, example: #^ISA, etc.
>>   (cond ((null here) nil) ; Stop when the well runs dry
>>         (t (cons here
>>                  (loop for there in (funcall by here)
>>                        collect (tree-walker there by)
>>                        )))))

>> (tree-walker np #^isa)
:: 
(#$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity (#$Go.Reaction)
 (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
  (#$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity
   (#$GO.CatalyticActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))
 (#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
  (#$GO.TransporterActivity (#$Go.Molecular_Function))))

>> (tree-walker #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity #^subclasses)
:: 
(#$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity
 ...
 (#$GO.MethaneMonooxygenaseActivity)
 (#$GO.PhthalateDioxygenaseReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.RubredoxinReductaseActivity
  (#$GO.Rubredoxin-Nad[P]+ReductaseActivity)
  (#$GO.Rubredoxin-Nad+ReductaseActivity))
 (#$GO.LeghemoglobinReductaseActivity)
 ...
 (#$GO.Nadph-HemoproteinReductaseActivity)
 (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenaseActivity
  (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenase[Quinone]Activity
   (#$GO.NadhDehydrogenase[Ubiquinone]Activity))))
</pre>

The only thing new in this function is this line: 
<pre> 
  (funcall by here) 
</pre> 

All that that does is to apply the function in BY to the current frame
(HERE). Notice that the value that we assigned to BY in each call was
either #^ISA or #^SUBCLASSES -- that is, the functions that get the
values from the frames. So all that the funcall is doing is applying
whatever function you gave as the BY argument to the TREE-WALKER
call. This is exactly the same thing as calling it by have. Watch:

<pre>
>> (#^isa #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
:: (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
 #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
>> (funcall #^isa #$GO.NadphDehydrogenaseActivity)
:: (#$Go.Reaction #$GO.OxidoreductaseActivity,ActingOnNadhOrNadph
 #$GO.ElectronTransporterActivity)
</pre>

See! Same thing! The only thing that FUNCALL does for us is to let us
use a variable to stand in for the function -- BY in the case of
TREE-WALKER. This seems like a samll thing, but it's actully a
<i>huge</i> thing because if lets you generalize any function to take
<i>other functions</i> as arguments!

<p>

Some day you'll learn to appreciate this simple thing... Really! :-)
