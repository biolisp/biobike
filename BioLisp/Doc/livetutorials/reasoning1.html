<a name=Introduction>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In previous tutorials we have been working mostly with biolisp in
order to do what we have been calling "symbolic biocomputing". We
explored regulation simulation, language analysis, and other
topics. In all those cases we programmed the algorithms in BioLisp --
usually from scratch! 

<p>

Now we're going to switch gears a little bit and talk about a
different approach to symbolic biocomputing. Whereas you might call
what we have done so far "procedural" biocomputing, we'll call this
new approach "declarative" biocomputing, or sometimes it's called
"automated reasoning". In procedural biocomputing we handle data
structures directly, sorting through them for various results, and
manipulating them in various ways. We did all that using the BioLisp
language (which is just the Lisp language running on BioBike). 

<p>

Automated reasoning works very differently. Instead of explicitly
searching through graphs and tables, or manipulating them, in the
automated reasoning world we <i>explain biology to the computer</i>,
and then ask it questions, and it figures out the answer on its
own. This sounds a little crazy -- like the computer is going to
understand our explanation and then figure things out?!

<p>

Well, we don't explain all of biology -- just a tiny part that we need
it to understand. And we don't explain it in English -- we'll use a
special way of representing biological knowledge in this tiny
part. And it can only do a certain limited kind of reasoning in
getting to the answers. But, as we'll see, this is a very different
way of thinking about biocomputing, and it'll take some time to get
used to it. (You're saying to yourself: I've hardly had the time to
get used to what we've already been doing!)

<p>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=Snark>
<h2>The Snark Theorem Prover</h2>

certain kind of reasoner called a theorem prover. The last time you
heard about theorems was probably in geometry class, but a theorem
prover actually isn't a geometrical thing; theorems are much more
general than geometry! Theorems are really just
<i>logical</i> or <i>symbolic</i> expressions that state some
conjecture (the "theorem") about some system, and the job of an
automated theorem prover is just to "prove" that conjecture (supposed
fact). (After it's proved, it gets to be called a theorem, before it's
just a conjecture.)

<p><hr><p>
<a name=Example>
<h2>A Simple Example</h2>
<p>

Let's take a natural example: Suppose that you know for an absolute
fact that Jeff is older than Bex, and that Bex is older than
Carrie. Now I <i>conjecture</i> -- that is I think it may be true that
-- Jeff is older than Carrie. Naturally, you would have no trouble
"proving" to yourself that this is true: If Bex is older than Carrie,
and Jeff is older than Bex, then obviously -- <i>logically!</i> --
Jeff is older than Carrie! <i>It just stands to reason!</i>

<p>

This is pretty much all that an automatic theorem prover does: It
takes a bunch of facts, like the age relations, and a bunch of rules,
like that if A is older then B, and B is older than C, then (it stands
to reason!) that A is older than C! (This is technically called
"transitivity" -- older-than-ness is a <i>transitive relationship</i>,
but, for example, it's <i>not</i> symmetric!: If Jeff is older than
Bex, the Bex is <i>not</i> older than Jeff! -- older-than-ness is
transitive, but not symmetric!)

<p>

This all seems pretty simple, and, well, it <i>is</i> pretty
simple. In this lesson we're going to see how automatic theorem
proving is done using a very complex automatic theorem prover called
"Snark", written by Mark Stickel at SRI. We'll start by doing this
entirely in the abstract, using our older-than relationship. Later
we'll look at a more biologically interesting example.

<p><hr><p>
<a name=Setup>
<h2>Setting up SNARK</h2>
<p>
Before your first use of snark, you should do this from the biobike
listener:

<pre>
>> (load-module :snark)

... a bunch of random output ...
... and finally:

  ;; Module :SNARK loaded.

</pre>

This only has to be done <i>once</i> by <i>anyone</i>, so it's pretty
likely that someone has done it before you, but it generally can't
hurt to do it again, so why not go ahead; then you'll never have to
worry about it again.

<p>

Once Snark is loaded, there are some magic incantations that you need
to issue before you can actually write snark theorems and get it
to give you proofs

<p>

Now here's how you'd set up to use snark if it was already loaded:

<pre>
>> (use-module :snark)
</pre>

We'll put that in some code we'll need to use in a moment:

<pre>
>> (progn
>>   (use-module :snark)
>>   (do-snark-shadowing-imports)
>>   (shadowing-import 'snark::assert)
>>   (shadowing-import 'snark::?)
>>   (use-snark)
>>   (set-timelimit 200)
>>   )
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=forest>
<h2>First the Forest</h2>
<p>
Next we'll want to put in the snark code. Rather than walking through
each little bit and then bring it all together, as we have in previous
tutorials, we're going to show you all the code together <i>first</i>,
and just have you click through it. Then we'll take each little bit
apart. This way you'll have an idea of what a complete Snark program
looks like, and that it's not so horrifically huge, whereas if we did
it piece-by-piece first, you'd be completely lost. So here's the
roadmap -- just read and DOIT each piece without trying to understand
them in detail -- the details will come later:

<p>

This is the top level plan - it just calls the other functions to do
the work:

<pre>
>> (defun example-setup ()
>>   (init-biodeducta)
>>   (declare-example-sorts)
>>   (declare-example-constants)
>>   (declare-example-relations)
>>   (install-example-axioms)
>>   )
</pre>

This declares "sorts" -- that is, what types of things there are in
the world (just persons in this case):

<pre>
>> (defun declare-example-sorts ()
>>   (declare-sort 'person)
>>   )
</pre>

And this just tells us that each specific person is of sort (type)
person:

<pre>
>> (defun declare-example-constants ()
>>   (declare-constant 'jeff :sort 'person)
>>   (declare-constant 'bex :sort 'person)
>>   (declare-constant 'carrie :sort 'person)
>>   (declare-constant 'archer :sort 'person)
>>   (declare-constant 'monique :sort 'person)
>>   )
</pre>

This tells snark what relationships where are in the world, in this
case just one, called <b>older-than</b>, and that it relates persons
to persons (that is, both the 1st and 2nd arguments are of sort (type)
person).

<pre>
>> (defun declare-example-relations ()
>>   (declare-relation 'older-than 2 :sort '((1 person) (2 person)))
>>   )
</pre>

Here's the heart of things, the rules and knowledge; We'll talk a lot
about these below:

<pre>
>> (defun install-example-axioms ()
>>   (assert
>>     '(implies
>>        (and (older-than ?person1 ?person2)
>>             (older-than ?person2 ?person3))
>>        (older-than ?person1 ?person3))
>>      :name 'transitivity-of-older-than)
>>   (assert '(older-than jeff bex))
>>   (assert '(older-than bex carrie))
>>   (assert '(older-than carrie archer))
>>   (assert '(older-than monique carrie))
>>   )
</pre>

That's actually all there is for setting up the prolem. There's one
more pile of snark-specific magic you need. This just sets some of
Snark's huge number of parameters the way we like them:

<pre>
>> (defun init-biodeducta ()
>>   (setq prove-all t)
>>   (initialize)
>>   (use-resolution t)
>>   (use-factoring t)
>>   (assert-supported nil)
>>   (print-rows-when-derived nil)
>>   (print-rows-when-processed nil)
>>   (print-final-rows)
>>   (use-answers-during-subsumption t) 
>>   )
</pre>

Finally, we need to call all of that and ask a question:

<pre>
>> (defun ask-snark-once (query)
>>   (with-saved-variables-values 
>>    ('snark)
>>    (example-setup)
>>    (find-one query :answer query)
>>    ))
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=Testing>
<h2>Testing the Example</h2>
<p>
Okay, so that's the forest, before getting to each tree, let's see if
it actually works:

<pre>
>> (ask-snark-once '(older-than jeff archer))
</pre>

If everything's right, you'll get a <i>huge</i> amount of random
output (that we'll examine later), and then this result:

<pre>
  ((SNARK::QUESTION-- (OLDER-THAN JEFF ARCHER)) 
                    NIL (OLDER-THAN JEFF ARCHER)!)
</pre>

The fact that it came back with an answer means that it found a
solution -- this is like saying "Yes!"

<p>

Watch what happens when you try something that you know is false:

<pre>
>> (ask-snark-once '(older-than archer jeff))
</pre>

This will take a long time (for reasons we'll get into later on) and
eventually will say:

<pre>
  ((SNARK::QUESTION-- (OLDER-THAN ARCHER JEFF)) NIL :NONE)
</pre>

So :NONE means that it couldn't find any solutions.

<p>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=trees>
<h2>And now, the Trees!</h2>
<p>
Okay, let's talk first about what all this mysteriousity is supposed
to compute! All that we're doing in this example is simple inference
about who's older than whom. That is, suppose that we have a path
between A and B (symbolized as: Jeff &gt;&gt; Bex) and another Bex
&gt;&gt; Carrie, and Carrie &gt;&gt; Archer. Can we find out (prove)
that Jeff &gt;&gt; Archer? If older-than-ness is <i>transitive</i> (as
we described above), then, yes, of course: Jeff &gt;&gt; Archer
because: Jeff &gt;&gt; Bex, and Bex &gt;&gt; Carrie, and Carrie
&gt;&gt; Archer!

<p><hr><p>
<a name=Sorts>
<h2>Sorts and Constants: What things are there?</h2>
<p>
Now let's break that down and put it out in Snark terms. First we have
to tell it that there are some persons in the world. We do that like
this:

<pre>
(defun declare-example-sorts ()
  (declare-sort 'person)
  )

(defun declare-example-constants ()
  (declare-constant 'jeff :sort 'person)
  (declare-constant 'bex :sort 'person)
  (declare-constant 'carrie :sort 'person)
  (declare-constant 'archer :sort 'person)
  (declare-constant 'monique :sort 'person)
  )
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=Assertions>
<h2>Assertions: The Rules of the Game</h2>
<p>
Now we need to give it the paths. These are "asserted" in the function
install-example-axioms, as follows:

<pre>
  (assert '(older-than jeff bex))
  (assert '(older-than bex carrie))
  (assert '(older-than carrie archer))
  (assert '(older-than monique carrie))
</pre>

The transitivity of paths is also asserted there:

<pre>
  (assert
   '(implies
     (and (older-than ?person1 ?person2)
          (older-than ?person2 ?person3))
     (older-than ?person1 ?person3))
   :name 'transitivity-of-older-than)
</pre>

This is a little hard to read, but what it says, in English, is just:
<font color=green>"If there are three people, called persons 1, 2, and
3, if person1 is older then person2, and person2 is older than
person3, this implies that person1 is older than person3."</font> 

<p>

That's not so hard to understand. Basically, it's saying that, for
example, Jeff &gt;&gt; Carrie if both Jeff &gt;&gt; Bex, and Bex
&gt;&gt; Carrie. Since person 1, 2, and 3 can be any people at all,
this will work just as well for proving that Jeff &gt;&gt; Archer by
going, for example, from Jeff &gt;&gt; Carrie, as we just proved we
could do, and then, since Jeff &gt;&gt; Carrie, and Carrie &gt;&gt;
Archer, then Jeff &gt;&gt; Archer -- QED!

<p>

(Notice in the above that although there's a person called Monique, we
only know that Monique is older than carrie (Monique &gt;&gt; Carrie),
but we don't know who is older than Monique.  Also, of course, this
implication isn't strictly true! Two people could, in theory, be the
same age!)

<p>

It's <i>very important to notice that</i> this inference applies for
<i>any</i> persons 1, 2, and 3, and that that <i>once you make this
inference of older-than-ness between two persons, this is effectively
a new older-than-ness assertion -- it's as though you'd written:
(assert '(older-than person1 person3))</i>, and it acts <i>just
exactly like you had made that assertion</i> in further
computations.</i>

<p> 

<p><hr><p>
<a name=Goals>
<h2>Setting Goals: Demanding Proof!</h2>
<p>

Once all this is set up, all we had to do was to ask, which we did
like this in the first example:

<pre>
  (ask-snark-once '(older-than jeff archer))
</pre>

<p>

And that's just what the final result told us:

<pre>
((SNARK::QUESTION-- (OLDER-THAN JEFF ARCHER)) NIL (OLDER-THAN JEFF ARCHER))
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                |                             |
                           This was our                       |
                           question...                        |
                                             ... and here's our answer!
</pre>

In fact, if you look up a little ways in the huge pile of random
output, you'll see that it even told us how to get from Jeff to
Archer:

<pre>
...
(Row 2
   (older-than jeff bex)
   assertion)
(Row 3
   (older-than bex carrie)
   assertion)
(Row 4
   (older-than carrie archer)
   assertion)
...
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=more>
<h2>Setting More Complex Goals</h2>
<p>
Let's ask it for something slightly more complex.  Using the same
setup we can ask for all the ways that Snark can find to prove a
claim:

<pre>
 (defun ask-snark-all (query)
   (with-saved-variables-values 
    ('snark)
    (example-setup)
    (find-all query :answer query) 
    ))

;;; Now try it:

Enter: (pprint (ask-snark-all '(older-than jeff ?person2)))

  (The pprint just makes the output look nicer by wraping 
   it around at the end of reasonably sized lines.)

;;; This will take a LOT longer, and we'll leave out most of the output.
;;; Here's the final result:

(((SNARK::QUESTION-- (OLDER-THAN JEFF ?PERSON2)) NIL (LIST JEFF BEX))
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                       The question...                ... one answer

 (LIST JEFF ARCHER) (LIST JEFF CARRIE))
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...
           More answers!
</pre>

So, we can see that Jeff is older than Bex (which we already knew
because we told it that one!) and Carrie and Archer, too!  But note
that we are <i>not</i> able to prove that Jeff is older than Monique!
(Why?) Quiz: Formulate the query that finds all persons that are older than 
Archer...

<p>

...did you get something like this?

<p>

Let's try it the other way around: Who's older than Archer?

<pre>
Try: (pprint (ask-snark-all '(older-than ?person1 archer) )

(((SNARK::QUESTION-- (OLDER-THAN ?PERSON1 ARCHER)) NIL 
 (LIST CARRIE ARCHER))
 (LIST JEFF ARCHER) (LIST MONIQUE ARCHER) (LIST BEX ARCHER))

</pre>

Note that Jeff and Monique are both proved to be older than Archer
because each can be proved older than Carrie (Jeff &gt;&gt; Bex
&gt;&gt; Carrie &gt;&gt; Archer, and Monique &gt;&gt; Carrie &gt;&gt;
Archer).

<p>

We can also ask for all pairs of age relationships:

<pre>
Do: (pprint (ask-snark-all '(older-than ?person1 ?person2)))

(((SNARK::QUESTION-- (OLDER-THAN ?PERSON1 ?PERSON2)) NIL
  (OLDER-THAN CARRIE ARCHER))
 (OLDER-THAN JEFF ARCHER) (OLDER-THAN JEFF CARRIE)
 (OLDER-THAN MONIQUE ARCHER) (OLDER-THAN BEX ARCHER)
 (OLDER-THAN JEFF BEX) (OLDER-THAN MONIQUE CARRIE)
 (OLDER-THAN BEX CARRIE))
</pre>

So that's every provable older-than relationship!

<p>

Now, what happens if we put a loop into the system? Let's claim that
Archer is older than Jeff -- which is ridiculous, but Snark doesn't
know any better! To do this we're going to add an assertion, and then
ask the question:

<pre>
 (defun install-example-axioms ()
   (assert
     '(implies
        (and (older-than ?person1 ?person2)
             (older-than ?person2 ?person3))
        (older-than ?person1 ?person3))
      :name 'transitivity-of-older-than)
   (assert '(older-than jeff bex))
   (assert '(older-than bex carrie))
   (assert '(older-than carrie archer))
   (assert '(older-than monique carrie))
   (assert '(older-than archer jeff)) ; *** Here's the loop! ***
   )
</pre>

Now let's try it:

<pre>
Try: (pprint (ask-snark-all '(older-than ?person1 ?person2)))

(((SNARK::QUESTION-- (OLDER-THAN ?PERSON1 ?PERSON2)) NIL
  (OLDER-THAN CARRIE ARCHER))
 (OLDER-THAN ARCHER ARCHER) (OLDER-THAN JEFF JEFF)
 (OLDER-THAN MONIQUE BEX) (OLDER-THAN BEX BEX)
 (OLDER-THAN CARRIE CARRIE) (OLDER-THAN ARCHER CARRIE)
 (OLDER-THAN JEFF ARCHER) (OLDER-THAN MONIQUE JEFF)
 (OLDER-THAN BEX JEFF) (OLDER-THAN CARRIE BEX) (OLDER-THAN ARCHER BEX)
 (OLDER-THAN JEFF CARRIE) (OLDER-THAN MONIQUE ARCHER)
 (OLDER-THAN BEX ARCHER) (OLDER-THAN CARRIE JEFF)
 (OLDER-THAN ARCHER JEFF) (OLDER-THAN JEFF BEX)
 (OLDER-THAN MONIQUE CARRIE) (OLDER-THAN BEX CARRIE))
</pre>

Not too surprisingly, the result is wako because we <i>lied</i> to
Snark! (Archer is <i>not</i> really older than Jeff, and Archer is
<i>certainly not</i> older than herself!!) So now nearly every person
can now be proved to be older than nearly every other person,
including themselves, and people who we know are older than them! Is
anyone immune from this madness?!  (Hint: Draw the graph, including
the Archer &gt;&gt; Jeff loop, and see which person isn't
reachable. Confirm this observation by look at the above list!)

<p>

So, we've now got actually quite a lot of experience with Snark
theorem proving; essentially all that Snark does is to draw
conclusions from a set of assertions, some of which are called "base"
or "ground" assertions or "sentences", like:

<pre>
  (older-than Archer Jeff)
</pre>

and some of which are called "axioms", like:

<pre>
  (iff
     (older-than ?person1 ?person3)
     (exists (?person2)
             (and (older-than ?person1 ?person2)
                  (older-than ?person2 ?person3))))
</pre>

The base assertions are sort of like truths of the universe, and the
axioms tell Snark how to draw conclusions from sets of ground
sentences.

<a name=BioExample>
<h2>Example 2: Reasoning about Regulation</h2>
<p>
Okay, so now you're a theorem-proving expert; Let's try something more
challenging (and more biologically relevant!)

<p>

I'll be you can guess that we're going back to our old friend, Li et
al's <a href=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0305937101v1
target=_blank>(PNAS, 2004)</a> analysis of the yeast cell-cycle
network. Here, again, is the network:

<p>
<img src=livetutorial-files/reasoning1/jssymbiolietalfig1b.jpg>
<p>

(Go back and review the other tutorials that use this example if you
don't remember what it all means.)

<p>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=plan>
<h2>The Plan of Action</h2>
<p>
In the previous tutorials that used this example we wrote a program
that simulated the regulatory dynamics of this system: What happens
over time. This time we're going to <i>reason</i> about the network
itself. In order to do that we need to do just what we did above:
represent the system, and then explain the rules of reasoning to
Snark, and then ask Snark to reason about the system using those
rules. (That is, ask it questions.)

<p>

So, for the most part this will look exactly like the above, but with
different assertions.

<p><hr><p>
<a name=setup2>
<h2>Setup (again)</h2>
<p>
<p>

You're probably already got Snark setup, but in case you don't, here's
again how to do that:

<pre>
>> (load-module :snark)
</pre>

<pre>
>> (progn
>>   (use-module :snark)
>>   (do-snark-shadowing-imports)
>>   (shadowing-import 'snark::assert)
>>   (shadowing-import 'snark::?)
>>   (use-snark)
>>   (set-timelimit 200)
>>   )
</pre>

The example setup function and init-biodeducta functions are exactly
the same (you don't even have to redefine it if you don't want to!),
and you can use this, and the above magic, in all your code.

<pre>
>> (defun example-setup ()
>>  (init-biodeducta)
>>  (declare-sorts)
>>  (declare-constants)
>>  (declare-relations)
>>  (install-axioms)
>>  (install-ground-assertions)
>>  )
</pre>


<pre>
>> (defun init-biodeducta ()
>>   (setq prove-all t)
>>   (initialize)
>>   (use-resolution t)
>>   (use-factoring t)
>>   (assert-supported nil)
>>   (print-rows-when-derived nil)
>>   (print-rows-when-processed nil)
>>   (print-final-rows)
>>   (use-answers-during-subsumption t) 
>>   )
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=telling>
<h2>Telling Snark about Regulation</h2>
<p>
But everything else is different, of course, since we're doing a
different problem. 

<p>

First off, instead of people (persons) we have proteins:

<pre>
>> (defun declare-sorts ()
>>  (declare-sort 'protein)
>>  )
</pre>

And what are the proteins? (Hint, not: Bex, Jeff, Carrie, and Archer!)

<pre>
>>(defun declare-constants ()
>>  (loop for protein in '(SIZE CLN3 CLN12 MBF SBF
>>                          MCM1SFF CDH1 CLB12 CDC2014 CLB56 SWI5 SIC1)
>>        do (declare-constant protein :sort 'protein)
>>        ))
</pre>

Now we have to actually think a little. Proteins in the Li et al
example either activate (green arcs) or inhibit one another (red
arcs), so we'll obviously need an "activates" and an "inhibits"
relation, and we might want to ask about either case, which we'll call
"controls":

<pre>
>>(defun declare-relations ()
>>  (declare-relation 'controls 2 :sort '((1 protein) (2 protein)))
>>  (declare-relation 'activates 2 :sort '((1 protein) (2 protein)))
>>  (declare-relation 'inhibits 2 :sort '((1 protein) (2 protein)))
>>  )
</pre>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=network>
<h2>Representing the Network</h2>
<p>
And now we can use those to represent the network. This is just like
the old li et al representation, where we had things like: (size +
cln3), but now we use the Snark prefix notation, and either activates
or inhibits. 

<p>

Note that we don't need to tell it the CONTROLS relationships; those
will be inferred by Snark based on our rules (you'll see this in a

<h2>Regulation Rules!</h2>
<p>
Now comes the fun part: Making up the rules. First off, we want to
tell Snark that both activates and inhibits are kinds of control. That
is, either activation or inhibition imply a control relationship:

<pre>
  (assert '(implies (activates ?protein1 ?protein2)
             (controls ?protein1 ?protein2)))
  (assert '(implies (inhibits ?protein1 ?protein2)
             (controls  ?protein1 ?protein2)))
</pre>

Next we want to tell Snark that, just like older-than, CONTROLS is
transitive; that is, if A controls B, and B controls C, then A
controls C:

<pre>
  (assert '(implies (and (controls ?protein1 ?protein2)
                      (controls ?protein2 ?protein3))
             (controls ?protein1 ?protein3)))
</pre>

Putting those together into the install-axioms function:

<pre>
>>(defun install-axioms ()
>>  (assert '(implies (activates ?protein1 ?protein2)
>>             (controls ?protein1 ?protein2)))
>>  (assert '(implies (inhibits ?protein1 ?protein2)
>>             (controls ?protein1 ?protein2)))
>>  (assert '(implies (and (controls ?protein1 ?protein2)
>>                      (controls ?protein2 ?protein3))
>>             (controls ?protein1 ?protein3)))
>>  )
</pre>

<h2>Testing it All Out</h2>
<p>
Okay, so now we're ready to run some examples. Here's the function
that will run the examples for us:

<pre>
>> (defun ask-snark-once (query)
>>   (with-saved-variables-values
>>     ('snark)
>>     (example-setup)
>>     (find-one query :answer query)
>>     ))
</pre>

And prove to yourself that it works:

<pre>
>> (ask-snark-once '(controls size mbf))

Did it get the right answer?

>> (ask-snark-once '(controls mbf size))

Did it get the right answer?

</pre>

Okay, now the paste of resistance: Can it find complex control
relationships?

<pre>
>> (ask-snark-once '(controls size swi5))
</pre>

Did it get the right answer? Look back at the proof trace; can you see
the path it found?

<h2>Reprise</h2>
<p>
So we've now seen two simple examples of reasoning using the Snark
theorem prover. There were two points to doing the very simple age
example. First, I wanted to get you a little used to using Snark --
two examples, more practice; and practice makes perfect! But more
importantly, I wanted you to see that reasoning about complex
biological networks is really not much more complex than reasoning
about simple systems, like ages. The players are different, but the
rules of logic are the same -- transitivity in a relationship graph is
the same sort of thing whether you're talking about ages of people or
protein activations.

<p>

In future tutorials we'll do more complex reasoning, but it's really
all just about the same sort of thing: You tell if the types of the
objects (people or proteins); you tell it the relationships
(older-than, activates, inhibits, and controls), and you tell it the
rules of reasoning (the transitivity relationships of controls and
older-than, and that both activation and inhibitions are kinds of
controlling). The rest is done by Snark -- Pretty cool, huh? (That's
why they call it AI!)

<h2>How to Learn More about SNARK</h2>
<p>

If you want to learn more about Snark, <a target=_blank
href=http://www.ai.sri.com/snark/tutorial/tutorial.html>the Snark
manual</a> includes a tutorial that goes into depth on Snark and all
its myriad ways. You won't understand most of it (lord knows, I
don't!) but it'll give you a sense of the breadth of potential of
Snark.

<p>

There are many good tutorial web pages on Theorem Proving and
specifically Resolution Theorem Proving. Here are a couple:
