It's not your postload file.  It's the universal postload file for the organism
and it is loaded when the organism gets loaded.

As long as one person (presumably you, after you change the postload file)
does a :RELOAD? T then everyone will see the revised data.  In fact, if
someone happens to be running a program, they'll see it in the middle of
their computation!

You are misusing the term 'database'.  Each person does not have a database.
There is only one database, the MYSQL database of organism data.  The
database data lives out on disk.  Nothing you or anyone else does will
change it unless you do things like run SQL queries.  The data from the
database gets loaded (copied) into the Lisp process and stored in frames.
(That's what LOAD-ORGANISM does)
It's this copy of the data inside of Lisp (in the frame system) that you are
potentially modifying with instructions in the postload file.
Everyone sees this one copy of the data, but again, it has nothing
to do with the database data in the sense of possibly changing it.

The database data itself only gets changed when you give me a new .zip
file and I run the code that uploads that new data into the database files.


1.  ZIP FILE   (via upload procedure) --> DATABASE DATA

2.  DATABASE DATA (via LOAD-ORGANISM) -> Organism data in Lisp/frames

3.  Organism data in Lisp/frames (via postload processing) -> Transformed 
organism data in frames

Of course steps 2 & 3 are on a per-organism basis.

The trick is that LOAD-ORGANISM invokes the postload processing (Step 3) 
automatically
after it is done moving the data from the database into Lisp/frames.

One could theoretically run the postload processing independently of 
LOAD-ORGANISM
but that's not done.  (Although you probably could do it via the keyword 
arguments
to LOAD-ORGANISM).
