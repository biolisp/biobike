* WHAT IS THIS?

SLIME is the "Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs", a library
comprising some Common Lisp and some Elisp that can talk to each other
over a socket (using a protocol called SWANK), allowing a user to
interact with a Common Lisp image from within Emacs.

SLIME is most often used entirely from within Emacs--one runs M-x
slime and the Elisp code launches Common Lisp as a separate process
which then starts a SWANK server that listens on a socket until Emacs
connects to it, at which point you're off and running. From the user's
point of view, everything happens within Emacs.

It is also, however, possible to run things in a less integrated
fashion: from within any Lisp program it is possible to start a SWANK
server and then connect to the server using M-x slime-connect.

* A FEW IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT SECURITY

The SWANK protocol by itself provides no security. If it is listening
on an accessible port, anyone can connect to it and then has complete
control over the Lisp process, running with whatever privileges it has.

One way to secure things is to have SWANK listen only for connections
from localhost. Then only users who already have access to the machine
can connect to SWANK. (Though they still gain whatever privileges the
Lisp process is running with.) Remote access can then be provided by
setting up an SSH port forwarding process that will allow
authenticated connections from remote machines and then establish a
local connection to SWANK. Only users with the ability to ssh into the
box will be able to make such connections. FOR NOW, WE'VE DECIDED TO
FORGO WORRYING ABOUT SECURITY.
